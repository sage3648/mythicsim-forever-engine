# MythicSim Forever Engine

A Rust simulation engine for WoW Forever. Every Forever sim on
[MythicSim](https://mythicsim.com/wow-forever/sim) runs on it: Quick Sims, stat weights, Best
Gear, the trinket and race boards, the Build Lab and the healer sims. [Coverage](#coverage) says
what that covers and what it refuses.

The engine began as an exact port of [MythicSim's Go fork](https://github.com/sage3648/mythicsim-forever-engine-go)
of [wowsims Forever](https://github.com/ElliotWood/Forever): event order, random numbers and
float math match, so a sim the Go engine covers gives the same result and the same combat log
in either engine. Rust is 1.3x to 2x faster. Since October 2026 new Forever work happens here
only: the Go fork no longer takes patches and its frozen goldens guard what it covered, and
mechanics Go never had, starting with the healer sims, are built and checked in Rust alone
(see [Rust-only mechanics](#rust-only-mechanics)).

## Quick start

Install stable Rust, then run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sage3648/mythicsim-forever-engine.git
cd mythicsim-forever-engine
cargo test --locked
cargo run --locked --release -- check --infile fixtures/mage/prepared-v2/frost-reference.prepared.json
cargo run --locked --release -- sim --infile fixtures/mage/prepared-v2/frost-reference.prepared.json
```

`check` lists anything in an input that Rust does not support. `sim` runs the fight
and prints the same JSON result that Go prints. You do not need Go to build or test
the engine.

## Rotation presets

The default rotation of every spec MythicSim sims, and the other playstyles it offers, are in
[`presets/`](presets/README.md), one APL JSON file per rotation with an index by spec. They are a
mirror of the presets MythicSim runs; to propose a better rotation, open a pull request against
the file there.

## How it works

1. Rust prepares the character from the application's request: gear, stats, auras,
   spells and rotation ([prepared v2](docs/prepared-v2.md),
   [Rust preparation](docs/rust-preparation.md)).
2. A coverage gate checks the prepared input and refuses anything Rust cannot simulate
   exactly, with a reason for each refusal.
3. Rust runs the fight.

[`tools/route.py`](docs/routing.md) is what the MythicSim worker calls. It runs a request in
Rust, or says why it cannot. With the worker's `FOREVER_GO_FALLBACK` off, as on MythicSim, a
request Rust refuses fails with that reason; nothing runs in Go.

## Coverage

Every class and spec MythicSim offers runs in Rust: the Druid, Hunter, Mage, Paladin, Priest,
Rogue, Shaman, Warlock and Warrior damage and tank specs, with their talents, gear, buffs,
consumables, pets, tanking, item swaps and 2 to 5 targets, and the Holy Paladin, Priest,
Restoration Shaman and Restoration Druid healer sims. Rust prepares the character as well as
running the fight, so no part of a request goes through Go. Holy Paladin heal sims match Go
too, under the reference's rules: heals cast on the player and counted in full, as Go counts
them. Production prepares them with Forever's rules, which leave out overhealing.

The 812 production requests that fell back to Go, or needed the Go exporter to prepare them,
between 24 and 27 October 2026 all prepare and run in Rust: tank damage shields, Seal of Light,
Vampiric Embrace, item swaps onto weapons with procs, custom rotation sequences and the rest.
The coverage gate still refuses what Rust cannot simulate exactly, each refusal with a stable
reason code (see [routing](docs/routing.md)), and MythicSim fails such a request with that
reason rather than run it in Go.

A Quick Sim's timeline and combat log show the run's first fight. Rust keeps no per-iteration
DPS, so the fight nearest the median is not picked.

## The Go reference

The reference pin stays at Go revision `a667dce8492bd9fb94269a9f864289cb74006775`, the fork's
patches 190 to 192 on the last Go release. Every accepted fixture keeps its Go golden, so a change to a mechanic Go covers
still has to match it or explain why it no longer should. A match means the same behavior as
that Go engine, not proof of the live game. [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md) records how the pin
moved while Go led, and [docs/validation-summary.md](docs/validation-summary.md) lists the
comparison records.

## Rust-only mechanics

Mechanics the Go engine never had have no Go golden. They are checked against the game's own
numbers instead: the client spell rows, Wowhead Forever tooltips and logs, with focused tests
that pin the expected heal, cost or timing from those numbers. A request that reaches one runs
in Rust or is refused; it never falls back to Go, which would skip the spells it does not know.
The healer sims are the first: every Holy Paladin, Priest, Restoration Shaman and Restoration
Druid heal lands on a player who needs it, less the share real healers overheal (below), so
healing per second is what the healer's mana heals in a dungeon.

Where Rust departs from a mechanic the Go reference has, preparation follows Forever by default
and the reference with `Rules::GoReference` (`prepare --go-rules`), which every comparison with
the Go goldens and exporter uses. The departures:

- Pet hit, from Forever's developers on their tracker (22 October 2026): a Hunter's pet takes
  17/8 of its master's ranged hit as spell hit (Lightning Breath and the other magic pet hits),
  and a Warlock's demon takes 8/17 of its master's spell hit as melee hit, where the reference
  gives a Hunter pet no spell hit and a demon the whole spell hit.
- A Hunter's tamed pet, a fitted model from the client's creature table, Forever's pet sheets and
  level 30 beta logs (levels 11, 17 and 30; extrapolated to level 60). The pet's own attack power
  is 30% of the creature auto attack dps as attack power, 14 attack power a point of dps (4.2
  times the dps, 253.9 at level 60), with nothing from Strength; its weapon is the rest of that
  dps (the dps less that attack power over 14), 42.3 a second at level 60, a fifth either side;
  and it takes 10% of its owner's higher attack power, melee or ranged. The sheets of a level 11,
  a level 17 and a level 30 pet read 36, 61 and 103 own attack power, each the client's
  `ExpectedStat` creature dps (8.60, 14.56 and 24.69) times 4.2 rounded down, with the owner's 10%
  rounded down beside it (the three rows were checked against the table on 6 November 2026). A
  level 30 Cat's 152 logged swings before armor, 42 to 55 at 119 attack power and 46 to 59 at 146
  (1.2 second swing, Unleashed Fury 5/5), all lie inside this weapon's range with the Cat's 10%
  and happiness: the model gives 42.4 to 55.5 and 46.0 to 59.1, where the whole creature dps as the
  weapon puts 131 of them outside. The swing counts are those of the analysis of the logs, which
  are not in this repository; the table rows, the 3 sheet readings and the two swing ranges are
  reproduced by `the_own_attack_power_is_four_point_two_a_point_of_creature_dps` and
  `the_weapon_is_the_creature_dps_less_its_attack_power_share`. Only the shares are measured
  at level 30 and below: that they hold at level 60, where the creature dps row is the one
  input, is an extrapolation. The owner's higher attack power is the one the owner has at the
  reset (the ranged one for an Agility Hunter), inherited as a linear term, so it follows Aspect
  of the Hawk and the other ranged auras but never swaps to the melee one mid fight. The
  reference gives the pet Classic's numbers: 136 Strength at two attack power each less 20 (252),
  an 18.17 to 27.66 a second weapon and nothing of its owner's attack power. At level 60 that is
  41 dps of the pet's own against 60.5 (18.1 of attack power and 42.3 of weapon), plus the owner's
  tenth: the Beast Mastery Cat on the board request goes from 149 to 220 DPS and its Hunter from
  895 to 966 (+7.9%). The pet's abilities, focus, hit, crit and expertise are unchanged.
- A levelling Warlock's demons, from the client's rank rows and creature table and Forever's
  levelling logs (foreverlogs.gg public reports, 5 to 8 November 2026, levels 12 to 31). The
  reference's demon is the level 60 one at any level: Firebolt rank 7 and Lash of Pain rank 6,
  Go literals, and the level 60 Strength, Agility and melee weapon, so a level 12 Imp's Firebolt
  hit for 44 where the log reads 8.5. Below level 60 a demon casts the rank its Warlock's level
  teaches, each from its client row (wowf `SpellEffect`, `SpellLevels` and `SpellPower`):
  Firebolt ranks 1 to 7 (3110 to 11763), the row's base plus its points per level up to the
  rank's cap, its variance, coefficient (0.164 at rank 1 to 0.571 from rank 4) and cost (10 to
  115); Lash of Pain ranks 1 to 6 (7814 to 11780), 16 to 50, learned from level 20, costing 65 to
  160. A Succubus below 20, which its Warlock cannot summon, knows no Lash. A rank the spellbook
  lists is taken first; the addon reads the Warlock's spellbook, not the demon's, so today the
  level decides, which counts every rank as trained (4 of 6 logged Imps cast the top rank of
  their level, 2 one rank behind). The demon's weapon and its own Strength and Agility are the
  level 60 ones times the client's creature auto attack dps at the level over level 60's
  (`ExpectedStat`, 0.345 at 25), so its whole own swing follows the creature row as a Hunter
  pet's does. Its mana, Intellect and Spirit stay: the logged Imps cast Firebolt every 2.44
  seconds in runs of 13 to 19 at levels 12 to 18, where a pool scaled down would run dry after
  5. Against the logs, the Imp's mean non-crit Firebolt at levels 12 to 31 reads 3 to 21% over
  the engine (7.0 against 8.5 at 12, 12.5 against 12.9 at 18, 21.1 against 23.8 at 31), the gap
  the Warlocks' own spells show, the captures' unknown level 12 or 13 and an Improved Imp the
  captures cannot show; a level 25 Succubus's Lash of Pain is 17.5 against 17.2, and its swings
  through the client's level 26 creature armor are 32.4 to 41.1 against a logged 32 to 41 on a
  level 26 caster. The engine's demon is the reference's at level 60 and under `Rules::GoReference`
  (`tests/levels_demons_20261109.rs`, `tests/levels_demon_logs_20261109.rs`).
- A Summon Hawk hawk, a fitted model from Forever's level 30 combat logs (extrapolated to level
  60). A swing is a roll a third either side of 0.0815 of the creature auto attack dps over its
  2.5 seconds (10.7 at level 60, before Unleashed Fury) plus 0.0179 (before Unleashed Fury,
  0.0156) a point of the owner's ranged attack power, taken through the target's armor, on the
  melee special hit table with a crit roll at Ferocity's flat crit plus half the owner's crit (the
  higher of melee and ranged, as the pet inherits it). Four logs of 2,862 swings at 407 to 1,023
  owner ranged attack power read the swing before armor as 3.3 to 6.7 plus 0.0179 a point in every
  log (the client's level 30 row gives 0.0815 x 24.69 x 2.5 = 3.35 to 6.71), all with Unleashed
  Fury 5/5, which reaches the hawks as it does the pet; 4,340 swings with Ferocity 5/5 read 10
  plus half the owner's crit against targets 2 levels below to 3 above, and two logs without
  Ferocity half the pet's. The fixed part scaling with the creature dps (the hawk's own scaling
  row is not in the client files) and the slope holding at level 60 are extrapolations. The
  reference swings 0.35 of the dive bomb's base, 37.8 at level 60, whatever the ranged attack
  power, without armor and without a crit roll (community #703). On the Summon Hawk request in the
  fixtures (1,900 ranged attack power, 976 armor) the hawks' swings deal 5.5 thousand damage a
  fight against 5.0 thousand. The dive bomb, the hawks' hit and expertise (the owner's, as the
  pet's) and their uptime are unchanged. The prepared `summon_hawk` effect carries `guardian`.
- Improved Mind Flay, from its Forever tooltip ("Each instance of damage of Mind Flay deals 20%
  more damage than its previous instance of damage"): each tick deals the step more than the tick
  before it, compounding (1, 1.2 and 1.44 times the tick at two points), where the reference adds
  the step per tick (1, 1.2 and 1.4). The talent is a dummy aura run by a server-side script, so
  the client data has no stacking rule of its own.
- Level partial resists, from Forever's beta logs on foreverlogs.gg (23 October 2026): a target
  above the caster's level partially resists nothing, dot ticks and direct hits alike, so only
  resistance past the caster's Spell Piercing does. About 1,000 dot ticks and 100 direct
  non-binary hits on Razorfen Kraul and Scarlet Monastery bosses, which miss level 30 casters'
  Shadow Bolts a third of the time, all landed whole. The reference's level 63 boss partially
  resists 18% of them, 6% of the damage on average. The prepared target carries
  `no_level_partial_resist`.
- The raid's Expose Armor, from MythicSim's Discord (28 October 2026, Bae and Vrelk): a player
  who picks the raid's Expose Armor instead of its Sunder Armor should not gain from the pick, but
  the reference applies Expose Armor at full from the pull while Sunder Armor ramps a stack every
  default GCD, so a Hunter simmed 1,241 DPS with Expose Armor against 1,226 with Sunder Armor.
  Under Forever's rules, Expose Armor alone lands at full 3 s into the fight, which leaves the same
  6,750 armor-seconds of its 2,250 armor unapplied as Sunder Armor's ramp: the Marksmanship
  production request sims 609.87 against 609.86. With both, Expose Armor stays up from the pull.
  Forever preparation writes `external_expose_armor`.
- Flurry's charges, from three level 30 Warrior logs on build 1.60.1.70450 (magey/forever-warrior
  discussion 30, counted in wowsims/forever PR 745): with Flurry up, every white swing spends a
  charge whatever its outcome (misses 180 of 180, dodges 75 of 75, parries 72 of 72), and a
  Heroic Strike spends one only when it misses (23 of 23; landed ones 3 of 265, each sharing its
  moment with a white swing, dodged or parried ones 0 of 38). Cleave follows Heroic Strike, an
  assumption, as the logs hold one Cleave. The reference spends a charge on each landed white
  hit, Heroic Strike and Cleave included, and never on a miss. The prepared `warrior_flurry`
  effect carries `every_swing_spends`.
- Casting regeneration auras, from the client's mana regeneration interrupt aura (type 134),
  which acts as it is applied: Resourcefulness, Rapid Recuperation and Improved Stormstrike let
  more spirit regeneration continue while casting from the moment they are up. The reference
  raises the rate without refreshing its cached mana tick, so the buff acts only once a change of
  MP5, Spirit or Intellect refreshes it, which on a Survival Hunter is almost never. Each one's
  mana lands in a resource row of its own, named after the aura, as Innervate's does. The
  prepared player carries `casting_regen_at_once`.
- Mana totems in the results, from MythicSim's Discord (3 November 2026): Mana Spring Totem's
  party buff and Mana Tide Totem are MP5 auras, so their mana arrives inside the regular mana
  ticks, and the reference books all of it as regeneration while casting or not casting, which
  players read as the totem doing nothing. Each tick's share from a totem's MP5 lands in a
  resource row of its own, named after the totem (`src/core/fight/mp5_sources.rs`). The mana
  gained is the same; as with Innervate, the rest of the regeneration fills the mana bar first.
  The prepared player carries `mp5_sources`.
- Overhealing, from Forever's level 30 beta logs on foreverlogs.gg (1 to 24 October 2026, 74
  public reports): a healer sim counts each heal less the share real Holy and Discipline
  Priests, Holy Paladins and Restoration Druids and Shamans overhealed of it, such as Flash Heal
  1%, Holy Light 10%, Renew 16%, Prayer of Healing 23% and Healing Stream Totem 63%. Heals the
  logs do not hold yet (Greater Heal, Chain Heal, Prayer of Mending and the other heals above
  level 30) take the pooled share of their kind: 5.4% on one player at once, 16.7% over time,
  24.6% on a group. Shields keep their whole absorb. The shares are dungeon play at level 30 and
  will move with level 60 raids. The reference, like Go, counts every heal in full. The prepared
  player carries `overheal`, and each heal's overhealing is reported beside its healing
  (`src/prepare/overheal.rs`, `validation/2026-10-24-healer-overheal.json`).
- Heal over time crits, from Forever's level 30 beta logs on foreverlogs.gg (1 to 24 October
  2026) and the client rows: Renew, Rejuvenation, Regrowth and Healing Stream Totem ticks crit
  for 1.5 times the tick, between normal ticks on the same player (a Holy Priest's Renew ticks
  97 and crits 145 and 146, a Restoration Druid's Rejuvenation ticks 95 and crits 141 and 142).
  Pooled over 104 reports, 7.0% of 8,245 Renew ticks and 5.7% of 7,171 Rejuvenation ticks crit,
  near the casters' direct heal crit (9.4% and 5.9%); a tick that wholly overheals loses its crit
  flag, so heavy overhealers read low. Every heal over time row the healer sims use states
  Periodic Can Crit, the client bit damage ticks already follow. A tick rolls the healing crit on
  spell crit and the spell's crit bonus, as a direct heal does (Improved Regrowth's reaches
  Regrowth's ticks, as the talent names the whole spell), less what a damage tick does not take
  (Inner Focus). The reference, like Go, never crits a heal tick. Each prepared heal over time
  whose row says so carries `tick_can_crit`
  (`validation/2026-10-25-heal-tick-crits.json`).
- Conjured cooldown, from the client's item effects (1.60.1.70532, ItemEffect and
  ItemXItemEffect): every mana gem (Agate, Jade, Citrine, Ruby) is in spell category 1153 with a
  2 minute category cooldown, with Demonic and Dark Rune, the healthstones and Thistle Tea, so a
  mage who uses a gem cannot use a rune for 2 minutes, and the reverse. The reference gives the
  gems a category 30 timer of their own, which no Forever item has, so a gem and a rune went back
  to back. Forever preparation puts the gems on the category 1153 timer.
- A queued spell holds a rotation's move, from MythicSim's Discord (25 October 2026, Bae and
  MuRRRkn on the Survival weave): a player who has pressed a shot or strike in the spell queue
  window does not walk off before it fires. The reference starts the move at once, so a shot
  queued at the end of the global cooldown fired from inside its 10.5 yard minimum range and a
  Strider Kick queued as the weave stepped out fired from outside melee range, and both failed.
  On the Survival light weave that cost a Strider Kick or a shot every few cycles, and 3% haste
  lost 19 DPS because it moved the Auto Shot onto the global cooldown more often. Forever
  preparation writes `move_waits_for_queued_cast`; a spell out of range where the player stands
  does not hold the move.
- A melee swing leaves the Auto Shot timer alone, from Forever's bug tracker: the beta restarts
  the timer on every melee swing ("Ranged swing timer is reset by melee",
  https://github.com/ClassicWoWCommunity/forever-bugs/issues/14), and a Forever developer
  answered on 6 October 2026 "For Hunters, this is a Bug with Auto Shot"
  (https://github.com/ClassicWoWCommunity/forever-bugs/issues/14#issuecomment-6025122239), so the
  rule models the game as intended. The reference restarts the timer as if a shot had just fired
  on every white main or off hand swing and every Raptor Strike, so a weaving Hunter's next shot
  came a full shot after the last melee hit instead of when it was due: on the Survival weave
  reference request 32.8 Auto Shots a fight, now 39.3. Forever preparation writes
  `melee_keeps_auto_shot_timer`.
- A move arrives when its time is up (`move_arrives_at_destination`, Forever preparation): a
  rotation woken at the instant a move ends, before its end action runs, reads the destination.
  The reference reads the walk rounded to the millisecond, 5.001 yards for a step in to 5, takes
  the Hunter out of melee range with no move left to bring them back, and the rest of the
  iteration has no swings or strikes: the Go golden of the Survival weave
  (`survival-hunter-aspect-of-the-beast-over-hawk`) has iterations at 400 to 510 DPS from it, and
  a held move makes it far more common.
- A rotation with a move keeps looking through the global cooldown: in game moving needs no
  global cooldown, only casting waits on it, so a player watching a swing timer starts a walk
  when its condition turns true. The reference's idle rotation sleeps until the global cooldown
  ends unless a swing or a shot wakes it, so a walk whose condition turned true under the global
  cooldown started at its end. A rotation that looks under the global cooldown queues the spell
  for its end, so it also goes on from a queued instant as it goes off (one that cast; a queued
  spell that fails does not run it again): the reference runs no rotation then, and a step
  out waiting on that spell started a global cooldown late. Forever preparation writes
  `rotation_with_moves_looks_through_gcd`; it acts only on a rotation with a Move in its priority
  list, a group or a schedule, so every other rotation waits as before.
- The off hand's half swing wait counts from the start of the melee attack, from swing probe logs
  on the Forever beta (16 to 17 October 2026, dual wield, 2.72 main hand and 2.33 off hand): an
  Auto Shot turns the melee attack off, and a weave's `/startattack` turns it back on as the step
  in begins. The off hand's first swing came exactly half its swing after the attack went on in
  11 of 19 attack starts, and never half a swing after the Auto Shot turned it off (0 of 17,
  always 0.06 to 0.15 seconds later). On six walks in longer than half the off hand swing, it
  swung within 0.2 seconds of arriving, so the wait runs during the walk, and with the attack
  left on for 21 seconds over five walks out and back in without a shot, both hands swung on
  arrival every time. Forever preparation writes `off_hand_waits_from_attack_start`:
  a walk from outside melee range to a destination inside it starts the attack as it begins, the
  off hand swings no sooner than half its swing after that, and an attack still on adds no wait
  when the Hunter steps back in. The reference adds the half swing on every arrival, so on a dual
  wield weave that steps in after each Auto Shot and out after the main hand swing the off hand
  almost never swung: 0.0 swings a fight on our weave request, now 28.3.
- A critical white hit's rage, from Forever's combat logs of 9 October 2026 (counted in
  wowsims/forever 7c28cfa73): two Warriors' two-hand crits gave exactly twice the swing's rage, 21
  of 21 (16.2 to 32.4 over 13 crits, 14.8 to 29.7 over 8). The reference adds the rage of the
  swing before a two-hander's factor, so a two-hand crit gave 1.77 times its swing: 27.86 rage
  on the Arms production request's 15.75 swing, now 31.5. A one-hander's crit, either hand,
  already gave twice its swing and does not move. A bear's crit follows the same rule (Forever's
  development notes of 1 and 8 October raise the crit rage of warriors and bears alike), and
  moves nothing either: a bear's paw takes no two-hander factor here (8.65 rage a 2.5 second
  swing), so its crit already doubled. The prepared `rage_bar` effect carries
  `crit_multiplies_swing`. Arms gains 0.6% to 1.3% (the production request 703.68 to 708.83 DPS
  at 10,000 iterations); Fury and bears sim the same to the cent.
- Multi-Shot's cast, from our Forever beta combat logs on Warcraft Logs (reports
  Par9kghHbAVYptwm, TBqwNKxVW8H3narp and mJGyPgZAtr2T4YpX, quiver at 15% speed): all 121
  Multi-Shots have a cast start, a median 0.45, 0.45 and 0.44 seconds before the shot, and 0.32
  under Rapid Fire in the third. Its client row (2643) has no cast time, so the reference casts
  it at once.
  Forever preparation gives it a 0.5 second cast, which the ranged haste multiplier divides as it
  does Aimed Shot's (0.5 / 1.15 is 0.435, and 0.5 / (1.15 x 1.4) is 0.31 under Rapid Fire); its
  global cooldown and cooldown are unchanged, and like any cast it cannot start while moving.
- Autocast looks past a cooldown the GCD holds back (`autocast_skips_unready_cooldowns`,
  Forever preparation), as wowsims/forever does since 21 and 22 October 2026 (10b0e65f2,
  fbf5d98e8). Autocast Other Cooldowns took the first ready major cooldown and then applied the
  GCD rule to it alone (an explosive only while the GCD runs, any other only once it is ready),
  so a cooldown waiting for the GCD held back an explosive sorted after it, and through a run of
  hardcasts an explosive held back every cooldown behind it. Now each ready cooldown that fails
  the rule is passed over, and an explosive whose cast fits in the shortest GCD also waits while
  less of the GCD is left than its cast, so it never delays the next spell. The reference stops at
  the first ready cooldown.
- Idol of the Dream (220606) adds 2 seconds to Rip (Improved Rip, 446212, client 1.60.1.70532:
  a flat duration modifier on Rip's class mask), so Rip ticks once more at the same period; ported
  from wowsims/forever 8d879a401. The reference registers no effect for it.
- Jewel of the Guard Captain (270225) and Cleansed Vilebranch Icon (270276) give 8 spell damage
  and healing, tripled in Forest and Grassland areas (Wowhead Forever); the imported data had 32.
- Water Shield gives mana (`water_shield`, Forever preparation), from the client (1.60.1.70532)
  and MythicSim's Discord (26 October 2026, Maro): a critical spell of the shaman's, damage or
  heal, spends one of three globes for 2% of maximum mana, one globe every 3.5 seconds at most,
  and the cast has no cooldown since 70532 (it had 15 seconds). The reference registers the talent
  but no build could cast it.
- The racial pass of Forever's development notes of 26 October 2026 (Forever preparation; the
  reference keeps the 16 October racials). Human Ruthless gives 1% crit (was 2%) and Human Spirit
  10% Spirit (was 5%). Dwarf Earth Fury is gone and Artisan's Precision gives 1% hit with
  attacks and spells. Tauren Endurance is 5% health only. Orc Savage is gone and Command gives
  Hunter and Warlock pets 5% more damage. Skyborne Wind Blessed is 2% haste (was 3%). Read
  Ley Line's Energized is 50% more regeneration for 15 seconds (70532 had 100% for 30), cannot
  be cast while an Innervate is up, and an Innervate that lands removes it
  (`read_ley_line.innervate_replaces`). Skysight's Elemental Blessing is 15% movement speed for
  15 seconds (was 10% for 30). Attuned and Charged, which a Ley Line or an elemental convergence
  grants before the pull and which double those two, are not assumed. Client 1.60.1.70532 still
  has the old rows; the notes are the source until a client build carries the new ones. The
  notes' additions of 27 October (post 8): Orc Blood Fury's cooldown is 2 minutes (was 3),
  Troll Berserking lasts 15 seconds (was 10) and Touch of the Grave's internal cooldown is 15
  seconds (was 25); Attuned and Charged end on entering a raid, so they stay unassumed.
- The non-Mage rows of client 1.60.1.70630 that change a number (Forever preparation; the data is
  1.60.1.70425 and the reference keeps its values). Hunter's Mark rank 4 (14325, SpellEffect
  690991) gives every attacker 143 ranged Attack Power (was 71). The Spellstone's damage effects
  (1233765, 1233768, 1233770, "Increase Shadow Dam") name the Shadow school alone (mask 32; was
  Fire and Shadow, 36). Blood Craze (16488) carries the No Threat attribute (Attributes_1 0x400),
  so its heal over time puts out no threat. The Mage Revelation buff (1248808, SpellEffect
  1251976) also names bit 32768 of the second class mask word, which holds Arcane Barrage and
  Arcane Wrath. Rows that need nothing: Bloodthrill's marker aura (1289681) now lasts 5 seconds,
  the window the engine already opens (Overpower's 5 seconds, 1282733); Elemental Focus keeps its
  10% (ProcChance 10 moved to the effect as 100 and base 10); Amplify Curse hands Bane of Agony's
  50% to an aura on the target (a class mask of Agony's own, tooltip `$o1*($w2/100+1)`), which
  the whole tick factor of patch 177 already is. Holy Fire rank 1 (54), Twilight Focus's class
  mask, Fire Nova's line of sight bit and Dark Inspiration's aura type (80 to 137, still 15%
  Spirit) already agree with the data, and the engine starts Elemental Mastery's cooldown at the
  cast, as 70630 has it (the cooldown-on-event bit is gone). Lava Burst rank 3 and Windfury
  Weapon rank 2 are not the ranks cast, Multi-Shot 1289053 is a mob's bolt barrage, Feral
  Swiftness is movement speed, Gore Drinker is not modelled, and the Touch of the Grave
  attribute clears and the Curse, Rogue and Power Word: Shield attribute bits are read by
  nothing the engine computes.
- Winter's Chill is "your next Cone of Cold" (`winters_chill`, Forever preparation), from client
  1.60.1.70630 (talent 11180 and aura 12579): only Frostbolt, Frost Blast and a Fingers of Frost
  empowered Ice Lance can apply it, each stack makes the Cone of Cold deal 5% more damage and
  gain 7% of the mage's spell damage (12579 and 11180 effect 3, a flat share added before the
  hit is worked out), and the Cone of Cold uses every stack up as its cast completes. The stacks
  stay on the mage rather than the target (the client puts 12579 on the target), so rotations
  that test the aura keep working, and an area Cone of Cold gives every target the bonus. The
  reference stacks from any landed Frost damage and never consumes. The rest of the Mage rows
  of that build (Ice Barrier and Frigid Power, Frost Warding's absorb, Frost Blast's 0.271
  coefficient, Arcane Wrath's 6 second cooldown, Missile Barrage ignoring missiles and hearing
  Frost Blast) were already in the imported data and the code through hotfix push 112753.
- The rows of client 1.60.1.70707 (30 October 2026, which also carries the 28 October hotfix) that
  change a number (Forever preparation; the data is 1.60.1.70425 and the reference keeps its
  values). Trueshot Aura ranks 1 to 4 fall to 15, 22, 30 and 40 ranged Attack Power (rank 4, 20905,
  SpellEffect 698474, was 75), below rank 5's (20906) 50, so the aura is rank 5. Improved Fireball
  (11069, SpellEffect 688786) also shortens Arcane Wrath and Arcane Barrage (bit 32768 of the second
  mask word). Efficiency (19416, SpellEffect 696992) also cheapens Flanking Strike and Strider Kick
  (bit 2097152 of the third word). Every "Increased Hit Chance" row (15464 to 15468, 18066) gains a
  spell hit effect beside its melee hit, which gear hit already is under Forever's rules; Black
  Dragon Mail's two piece bonus (15464) now gives both. The Mage tree (TraitTree 1112) moves: Arcane
  Focus (11222, TraitNode 105814) is removed, so the Arcane tree has 18 talents; Improved Channeling
  (105813) takes its square and Arcane Resilience (105802) Improved Channeling's, and Missile
  Barrage and Arcane Resilience swap TraitDefinitions 135332 and 135339, which puts Missile Barrage
  in the second row. Improved Fire Blast (105797) moves from the Fire tree's first row to the third,
  after Pyroblast. Forever preparation reads the talent string in that order (a 19 digit Arcane tree
  is refused) and the reference in Go's. Critical Mass (11115) falls to 3 ranks (TraitNodeEntry
  130513) and Incineration (18459) rises to 5 (130525); their curves (83083, 83095) keep 2% a rank.
  A string with a talent above its ranks in this build is refused, since an old string read in the
  new order can put five points in a two rank talent. Precision (29438, Elemental Precision until
  this build; SpellEffect 704780) turns from a miss chance modifier on Fire and Frost spells into
  spell hit chance (aura 55) for every school, Arcane included. Improved Fireball is renamed
  Accelerant. Frost Blast's three SkillLineAbility rows (1326053 to 1326055) leave the Frost skill
  line without reaching another skill line or the trait tables, while its spell rows and the talent
  tooltips naming it stay; the engine keeps it until the data says whether a level 60 mage still
  learns it. Rows that need nothing: Aspect of the Hawk ranks 1 to 5 fall to 15, 22, 30, 38 and 47
  but the engine casts rank 7 (25296, unchanged 120); Missile Barrage's channel time effect and
  Fengus' Ferocity's effects become dummy auras that keep their amounts (a server script), Lesser
  Intellect (Elixir of Wisdom, 6 to 3) and Well Fed (1249521) are not consumables the engine offers,
  Tauren Endurance's crit damage row names every school (the racial follows Blizzard's 16 October
  notes, health only), and the Bane of Agony marker, Surefooted's new row id and the creature,
  transmute and event rows are read by nothing the engine computes. Ice Lance's new 8 second
  cooldown is on rank 1 (1312002) alone, not the rank cast at level 60.
- Live server hotfix pushes 113531 and 113554, which reached client 1.60.1.70707 on 30 October
  2026 through the DBCache rather than a client build, for every class but Paladin and Priest
  (Forever preparation, `prepare::hotfix_113554`; the reference keeps the frozen rows). The rows
  are wowsims/forever #769 and #770's, regenerated from Raidbots' `forever` DBCache.bin, and the
  trees agree with Wowhead's Forever talent data. The Druid tree is read in the hotfix's order:
  Berserk (417141), Improved Shifting Power (1322670) and Gift of the Earthmother (414673) are
  gone, Furor and Heart of the Wild swap trees, Reflection and Subtlety swap, and the new
  Lacerate (1328617), Predatory Discipline (1328613) and Bloom (1328621) are talents the pinned
  proto has no field for (`prepare::talent_layout` reads them aside). Lacerate needs the talent;
  with Predatory Discipline a landed Ferocious Bite keeps the energy left after its cost; Primal
  Bite's level 60 rank is 1238070 (1238073 is gone, same 77 flat damage); Shifting Power's
  cooldown is 8 seconds; Wild Growth takes a 3 second cast that Naturalist shortens; Naturalist's
  damage and Genesis are 2% a rank. Bloom is modelled from its text alone (below).
  Moonkin Aura and Leader of the Pack are both 3% of every kind of crit, and one counts (the
  `RaidCrit` category, as #769 rules). Mage: Arcane Resilience has 3 ranks, Ice Lance's Frozen
  bonus is 300% and every rank has an 8 second cooldown on Fire Blast's category 19, Winter's
  Chill is 20% a stack, Arcane Blast's buff is 12% of Intellect, 100% more cost and 18 seconds,
  Ice Barrier's Frost damage is 5% and Frigid Power's 15%, and Arctic Reach lengthens Ice Lance.
  Hunter: Pathfinding and Improved Revive Pet swap squares in Beast Mastery, and Freezing Trap
  shares Explosive and Immolation Trap's category 411. Warlock: Improved Drains leaves Wrack out
  (its second effect raises Drain Mana, which the engine does not cast). Greater Blessing of
  Salvation and Greater Blessing of Light are gone from the game and apply nothing. Rows that
  need nothing: Boosted Critical Chance (1229519) and the Minor Speed and Speed boot enchants
  (911, 8737) are not read by the engine, Summon Arcane Elemental's middle spell is not modelled,
  Ferocious Bite's new rank 1 and the two low Lacerate ranks leave the level 60 ranks, and about
  1,400 rows only gain Attributes_14 bit 64.
- Blizzard's development notes of 2 November 2026 for Hunter and Druid (Forever preparation; the
  reference keeps the frozen rows and Go's numbers). Hunter, from the live hotfix cache of 3
  November (still client 1.60.1.70707, regenerated by wowsims/forever #824; the rows are in
  `prepare::hotfix_113554`): every rank of Aimed Shot (rank 6 166 to 350), Arcane Shot (rank 8
  217 to 280), Serpent Sting (rank 8 83 to 100 a tick) and Sniper Shot (rank 3 295 to 590), and
  Aspect of the Hawk ranks 1 to 6 (rank 6, the rank without the Ahn'Qiraj 20 book, 55 to 110).
  Trueshot Aura rank 5 gives 100 ranged Attack Power (was 50) and Barrage is 5/10/15% (was
  3/7/10%). Arcane Shot takes 15% of ranged Attack Power (was 10%) and each Serpent Sting tick
  5% (was 3.5%), the notes' numbers, which no row states. Lightning Reflexes is already 3% a
  rank in the frozen data, and Pathfinding already sits on row 3. Druid, from the notes alone
  (the client has no rows for them yet, as #823 finds): Shred, Claw and Ravage deal 200%, 140%
  and 435% weapon damage (were 155%, 110% and 350%), Rend and Tear is 3% a rank (was 2%), and
  Bear Form's threat bonus is 115% (was 50%). Rip, Rake, Ferocious Bite and Starfire are "about
  25%" and "about 40%" higher in the notes; the live rows of 4 November state them (the bullet
  after Riptide and Poised below). Not modelled: Pounce
  (the engine does not cast it), and the end of the low rank talent proc penalty (the engine
  casts level 60 ranks). Poised is in the last bullet of these notes.
- The same notes for Warrior, Warlock and Shaman (Forever preparation, from the notes alone; the
  rows are in `prepare::hotfix_113554`). Warrior: Defensive Stance's threat bonus 80% (was 30%),
  Slam's cooldown 15 sec (was 18), Two-Handed Weapon Specialization 2/4/6% (was 1/2/3%),
  Improved Slam's cooldown cut 2.5/5 sec (was 3 at either rank) and Defiance 7/13/20% (was
  5/10/15%). Warlock: Wrack's spell damage coefficient doubled (0.143 to 0.286 a tick) and its
  base damage a second growing 2.5 a level from level 40, so 86 at 60 (was 36 at every level),
  and Shadow and Flame's Shadow and Fire bonus 4/8/12/16/20% (was 2/4/6/8/10%; its chance to keep
  Immolate is unchanged). Shaman: Lightning Overload 10/20/30% (was 3/7/10%), Mental Dexterity
  50/100/150% of Intellect (was 33/67/100%), Flurry 6/12/18/24/30% (was 5/10/15/20/25%),
  Stormstrike at 150% weapon damage on a 6 sec cooldown (was 100% and 8 sec) and Maelstrom
  Weapon at 20 procs a minute (was 10). Not yet taken, since the client has no rows or trees for
  them: the Arms and Fury tree changes, pet health and spellstones (Lightning Bolt,
  Chain Lightning, the shocks and Lava Burst are in the next bullet). `tools/dev_notes_check.py`
  checks every number of these bullets against a live client spell store.
- The rest of the Shaman changes in the development notes of 2 November 2026 (Forever
  preparation, the reference keeps the frozen rows; the rows are in `prepare::hotfix_113554`).
  The damage rows are Wowhead's Forever tooltips of 4 November 2026 (the live client's, rows the
  launch build encrypts included; each tooltip carries its row as `ppl<level>:<max level>:<base>:
  <points per level x 100>`), which replaced the first pass's derivation of the notes' ratios.
  Lightning Bolt: base 16, 30, 52, 73, 109, 148, 194, 240, 295 and 353 for ranks 1 to 10 (rank 10
  was 196) and 0.1 to 2.1 a level (rank 10: 2.1, was 1.2), so 361 at level 60 (was 200). Chain
  Lightning's primary target damage: base 215, 348, 428 and 510 (rank 4 was 123) and 1.4, 2.2, 2.7
  and 3.3 a level, so 523 at level 60 (was 126). The shocks are Classic Era's: Earth Shock rank 7
  531 (was 301), Flame Shock rank 6 292 and 80 a tick (was 166 and 44) and Frost Shock rank 4 506
  base, 509 at level 60 (was 283 and 286). Chain Lightning's cast time is the notes' 2.5 sec
  (was 2), which Wowhead's live tooltips of 6 November 2026 state on every rank, and its mana is
  those tooltips' 245, 360, 425 and 495 (the notes' "approximately 225%" of the comparable
  Lightning Bolt rank's, which the first pass read as 248, 304, 428 and 495, is replaced by the
  live rows; the frozen rows say 145, 200, 250 and 315), with the coefficient 0.714 (was 0.571),
  which Wowhead's spell pages state on all four ranks. Lightning Overload's copies deal half their
  rank's base and level scaling, since the talent's text says "half damage" ("a second, similar
  spell on the same target at no additional cost that causes half damage and no threat"), where
  Wowhead's tooltips of the copy rows still state the old rows on every rank (rank 10 Lightning
  Bolt 98, rank 4 Chain Lightning 62) while every primary row moved: the top ranks deal 180 and 261
  at level 60, what they dealt before, and the lower ranks follow their new primaries. Lava Burst
  is removed: its talent slot (position 13 of the Elemental tree,
  so saved talent strings keep their positions) gives Call of Thunder, +5% critical strike chance
  for Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning and their Lightning Overload copies (Wowhead's talent text
  names the two spells), and no Lava Burst spell is registered, so a rotation line naming it finds
  no spell and is dropped, as an unknown spell is. Elemental Mastery's aura reads Lightning
  Mastery (the name only). Chain Lightning applies its jump reduction to the second and third
  target only: the primary hit is the full row (checked against a combat log, first target 1.19
  times Lightning Bolt's with the same coefficient and gear); a report of it hitting for less
  than Lightning Bolt compares the average of all three hits with Lightning Bolt's. Not modelled:
  the Windfury animations, Totemic Call and Elemental Reach's cooldown. Riptide is in the last
  bullet of these notes. `tools/dev_notes_check.py` lists each row.
- The same notes for Rogue, the changes that do not depend on the new talent trees (Forever
  preparation, from the notes alone; the rows are in `prepare::hotfix_113554`, the reference keeps
  the frozen data). Instant Poison takes 1% of attack power (was 0.5%) and Deadly Poison 0.9% a
  tick and stack (was 0.45%), Mutilate deals 90% weapon damage with each hand (was 75%; the flat
  damage each hand adds is multiplied by the same share, which is how the notes' "additional amount
  that was also increased" follows, since no row or note gives the amount on its own), Hemorrhage's
  15% damage taken applies to the rogue's Garrote as well as Rupture, Flawless Execution takes 15
  Energy off Eviscerate (was 10), Aggression is 5/10/15% on Sinister Strike and Eviscerate only
  (was 2/4/6% on those and Backstab), and Efficient Strikes (Improved Sinister Strike) takes 3/5
  Energy off Hemorrhage as well as Sinister Strike. Shank (learned at level 24; a level 60 rogue
  has rank 2) and Poised are new baseline abilities: Shank costs 5 Energy on a 10 sec cooldown and
  strikes with the off hand weapon for 50% weapon damage, generating 25 Energy, and exists only
  while an off hand weapon is held; it cannot miss, so it rolls as each hand of Mutilate does
  (blocked or critical, never missed, dodged or parried), is on the Global Cooldown and takes the
  off hand's damage penalty like the other off hand strikes. Poised is up at the start of every
  fight (out of combat at maximum Energy) and takes 10 Energy off the first Energy ability. The
  client now states both (see the rework bullet below), so Shank is 1329549 and Poised's aura is
  1328826. Already the engine's: Improved Eviscerate, renamed Coup de Grace, is 7/13/20% in the
  client data, and Improved Sinister Strike is 3/5 Energy. Hemorrhage and Ghostly Strike "dealing
  much more damage than intended with a Dagger" is a server side fault the engine does not share:
  it reads the client's dagger effect (145% and 180%) in place of the plain share, never on top of
  it, and the live store of 3 November still states those numbers. Death Mark is in the next bullet. `tools/dev_notes_check.py` checks the rows of the Rogue part too.
- The Rogue rework of hotfix pushes 113351 (Poised) and 113483 (the trees), client 1.60.1.70755
  with hotfixes to push 113583 (wowsims/forever #840's store; Forever preparation, the reference
  keeps the frozen data and `fill_talents`' proto order). The three trees are read in the client's
  own order (`classes::rogue::prepare`, through `prepare::talent_layout`: Assassination 17
  talents, Combat 19, Subtlety 18), so a string written for the old trees that does not fit (a
  talent above its ranks, a tree too long) is refused under `talents` with the talent named, and
  one that happens to fit is read in the new order. Murder, Quietus, Cutthroat, Thousand Cuts and
  Improved Distract are gone; Blood Splatter, Composure, Flash of Steel, Boot Knife, Death Mark
  and Quick Getaway are new, and so are read into the layout's extras, with Relentless Strikes'
  five ranks (its proto field is a bool). Rank counts and values: Lethality 10/20%, Seal Fate
  33/66/100%, Opportunity 4/8/12/16/20% (Backstab, Garrote, Ambush and Mutilate), Dual Wield
  Specialization 25/50%, Relentless Strikes 4% a Combo Point a rank for 25 Energy, Camouflage
  and Setup three ranks (nothing the engine reads). Shank is Shank rank 2 (1329549; rank 1 is
  1329283, level 24, 15 Energy), 5 Energy, a 10 sec cooldown, 50% off hand weapon damage and 25
  Energy; a rotation that names 1329283 or the provisional 1399001 of #200 presses it. Poised's
  aura is 1328826 (the passive is 1328825). Composure adds 5 or 10 to Poised's 10 (15 or 20
  off the opener). Flash of Steel adds 3 a rank to Shank's Energy and takes 0.4 sec a rank off
  its cooldown (the row's effect says 2.5 sec at the top; the trait curve and the calculator say
  2.0, which is used). Boot Knife gives a landed Shank a 20% a rank chance to add two Combo
  Points (1329285; Shank's tooltip says one, its rows and the talent text say two). Venom is no
  finisher: a Shank puts up 1310703 for 6 sec (30% poison damage, 20% poison chance). Blood
  Splatter lengthens Rupture by 6 sec and Garrote by 9 sec, as three more ticks each (the
  spell row and its Wowhead tooltip read 4 and 6; the trait curve, Wowhead's calculator and
  upstream read 6 and 9, which is used). Mutilate's flat damage by rank is 44, 63 and 88 (33,
  48 and 67 before) beside the 90% weapon share. Ghostly Strike's damage is normalized (the
  row's new normalized weapon damage effect), and a Ghostly Strike puts up 1329326 for 7 sec,
  which lets the next Ambush or Garrote out of Stealth (what Cutthroat gave Ambush). Death
  Mark (rank 4 is 1325758; ranks 1 to 3 are 1316709, 1325756 and 1325757, which press it) is a
  finisher for 25 Energy and a Combo Point or more, a 10 sec cooldown and 20 yd range, from
  its rows; its tooltip, which Wowhead's Forever data carries since the morning of 4 November,
  states the rest: 12% a Combo Point of the damage the rogue deals the target for 6 sec is
  stored (twice that for Garrote and Rupture), then dealt up to a cap of (156 + 245 a point +
  0.04 attack power a point) times (1 + melee crit chance), and Coup de Grace's 7/13/20%
  multiplies both the share and the cap. Approximate: the tooltip does not say which damage
  counts or how the release rolls, so every hit and tick of the rogue's other spells counts (the
  damage after armor), a miss stores nothing, the release is a hit that cannot miss or crit and
  takes no armor or multiplier again, and a mark still up when the fight ends releases nothing.
  Not modelled: Quick Getaway, and the stat parts of Camouflage and Setup.
  `tools/dev_notes_check.py` checks every row and curve above.
- Riptide and the Druid's Poised, the last numbers of the same notes the client does not state yet
  (Forever preparation, the reference keeps the frozen rows; `prepare::hotfix_113554`). Riptide
  costs what Wowhead's tooltips of 4 November 2026 state: 245, 300 and 230 mana for its three
  ranks (385 before for rank 3, the notes' "about 40%" less; ranks 1 and 2 read their old costs
  there), has a 12 sec cooldown (the notes; was 6 and Wowhead states 12 on all three) and "no
  initial heal, only the heal over time": its heal effect is turned into an inert dummy so the
  heal over time (89, 115 and 161 a tick, the rows Wowhead's buff tooltips state too, five ticks
  over its 15 sec) and the 25% Chain Heal bonus on the holder keep their effects. Only the
  Restoration shaman's healer sims read it. A rotation that casts Riptide on its cooldown keeps it
  on its target (15 sec outlasts the 12 sec cooldown), so the preset needs no edit for the
  cooldown, though each cast now heals only its ticks. Poised for Druids (learned at level 32;
  "when you are not in combat and have your maximum Energy, you will gain Poised"; the next Energy
  ability costs 10 less) is the Rogue's mechanic (`core::fight::poised`, shared by both classes):
  a Cat Form druid starts the fight with the aura up at maximum Energy and the first Claw, Shred,
  Ravage, Rake, Rip or Ferocious Bite that applies its effects spends it, so Ravage from Prowl
  costs 50 (60 before). Its aura is spell 1328827 (the -10 Energy row of hotfix push 113578; the
  level 32 passive that grants it is 1328829), which replaced the provisional id 1399003 the
  notes needed before the client had a row. A druid that shifts into Cat Form during the fight, after the pull,
  gets none. Warrior talent strings that put more points in a talent than it has ranks, or list
  more talents than a tree has (42 of 509 benchmarked community builds: 35 with an 18 talent Fury
  string, the proto's tree having 17, and seven with Improved Execute or Improved Bloodrage above
  their two ranks) are refused under `talents` with the talent named (`prepare::talent_layout`,
  the way the Mage, Hunter and Druid trees are), where the rank ladders used to panic with "rank 5
  in a ladder of 2 ranks"; the Warrior's client order came with the next entry. `tools/dev_notes_check.py`
  checks Riptide's cooldown and mana against a live store.
- The Druid rows of the live client of 4 November 2026 (Forever preparation; the reference keeps
  the frozen rows; `prepare::hotfix_113554`), read from Wowhead's Forever tooltips and spell pages,
  which decode the launch rows the upstream stores still lack. They replace the 1.25 and 1.4
  placeholders of the notes' "about 25%" and "about 40%". Rip rank 6 ticks 19 plus 31.9 a combo
  point every 2 sec (was 15 plus 25.5; the tooltip's 305, 497, 688, 880 and 1071 over 12 sec and
  the buff text "19 + (32 * Combo Points)"). Rake rank 4 hits for 76 and bleeds 42 every 3 sec
  (was 61 and 34). Ferocious Bite rolls 102 spread over 76 (was 82 spread over 60), adds 181 a
  combo point (was 147) and 3.3 a point of extra Energy (was 2.7; the notes left it alone, the
  row did not), reproducing the tooltip's 245 to 321 at one combo point up to 969 to 1045 at five.
  Starfire's base damage and damage per level on every rank are 113, 154, 201, 277, 372, 471 and
  533 with 1.8, 2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 3.0, 3.2 and 3.4 a level (were 81, 110, 144, 198, 266, 337 and 381
  with 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4), the row's spread unchanged: rank 7's tooltip reads
  510 to 597 at its level 66 cap, 533 at level 60. Shred, Claw and Ravage read 200%, 140% and
  435% in the rows already. No row or tooltip states the attack power shares of Rip, Rake and
  Ferocious Bite (server side), so they kept the notes' 25% (1.25 times 1%, 5% and 3% a point);
  Rip's and Rake's are now the measured shares in the last bullet of the departures, and Ferocious
  Bite's alone keeps the 25%.
  Rend and Tear stays 3/6/9/12/15%: the live tooltip's "20%" is the row's own base points (20 in
  the frozen data too, beside a per rank curve of 2 to 10), the way Genesis reads "1%" and
  Naturalist "100%". Bear Form's threat stays the notes' 115% (its tooltips state none), and
  Moonfire, Wrath, Insect Swarm, Predatory Strikes, Naturalist and Genesis read as the engine has
  them. Pounce rank 3 now reads 186 over 18 sec (was 150) and is not cast by the engine.
  `tools/dev_notes_check.py` has the rows.
- The rest of the tree independent lines of the same notes, for Paladin and Mage (Forever
  preparation, from the notes alone: no row states them yet, so the reference keeps the frozen
  data). Paladin: Vengeance stacks up to 5 times (was 3; the 1/2/3% a stack is unchanged, and
  its new requirement of Seal of Command is a tree rule) and Two-Handed Weapon Specialization
  raises Holy damage as well as Physical, by the same 2/4/6% while a two-hander is in the main
  hand (a Holy heal is not damage and keeps its value; the threat cut came with push 113554).
  Mage: each missile of Arcane Missiles that lands rolls for Arcane Concentration, with the
  talent's chance and internal cooldown, and an Arcane Missiles cast that finds Missile Barrage
  up beside a Clearcasting from before leaves the Clearcasting standing (the cast's free pass is
  Missile Barrage's). The notes do not say whether the cast or each missile rolls; each missile
  is this engine's reading. Judgement of Fury's 4 to 3 sec is its taunt, which the sim does not
  model. Every other Druid, Hunter, Mage, Paladin, Priest and Warlock line of the notes is
  already in the engine (pushes 113531 and 113554, clients 70630 and 70707, and the first pass
  above) or does nothing in a sim. Not taken: Poised (the next Energy ability after
  the pull costs 10 less, about 10 Energy once a fight); Pounce (the engine does not cast it);
  Frost Blast's removal (a rotation may still cast it); Ignite from Flamestrike's ticks (the
  notes do not say a tick can crit, and only area rotations cast it); Gore Drinker (not
  modelled); and the end of the low rank proc penalty (the engine casts level 60 ranks and never
  applied one).
- The Warrior trees of the same notes, from the client's rows (the hotfix cache of 3 and 4
  November, build 70755 up to push 113596: wowsims/forever #841's regenerated store, which states
  the talent curves, and Wowhead's Forever talent calculator, which lists each tree's order and
  ranks; `prepare::trees_20261104` and `prepare::talent_ranks`). Forever's rules read the client's
  own order and the Go reference keeps the proto's. Arms keeps its order with Improved Tactical
  Mastery at 3 ranks (5/10/15 Rage, the same top value) and Bloodthrill at 2 (10/20%). Fury has 18
  talents, row then column: Booming Voice, Cruelty, Lingering Rage, Unbridled Wrath, Furious
  Precision, Piercing Howl, Blood Craze, Enrage, Dual Wield Specialization, Reckless Swings,
  Improved Execute, Improved Berserker Rage, Death Wish, Gore Drinker, Improved Intercept,
  Improved Whirlwind, Flurry and Bloodthirst. Raging Blows leaves, and its Rage discount on Cleave
  and Whirlwind with it (the engine never had Boundless Rage, Improved Cleave or Precision in
  Fury, and Iron Will is Protection's third talent, as it already was). Bloodthirst now needs
  Death Wish, a tree rule the engine does not check. Protection is unchanged. A string that does
  not fit is refused with the talent named ("Improved Tactical Mastery has 3 ranks, the string
  gives 5"; strings written for the old order that happen to fit are read in the new one, so an
  app must re-encode its Warrior builds when it moves to this layout). Flurry has 3
  ranks of 10/20/30% attack speed for 3 swings (the charge rules of the entry above are
  unchanged). Improved Whirlwind (1310315, the id Raging Blows had): Whirlwind's cooldown 1/2 sec
  shorter and 15/30% more damage to the closest enemy, which is read as the first target of each
  strike, the cast target, for both hands (the `whirlwind` effect's `closest_bonus`; the threat
  follows the damage), as upstream reads it. Reckless Swings (1329555): for 25% of base health,
  a 15 sec cooldown and a 1 sec Global Cooldown, the next 4 melee swings within 8 sec give 5 Rage
  (proc 1329554). The row's proc is each melee auto attack, so a landed white swing that dealt
  damage gives the Rage and spends a charge a spell batch window later, and Heroic Strike and
  Cleave do not count, as for Unbridled Wrath; upstream notes no one has checked in game which
  swings spend the charges. A rotation casts it by its id (`castSpell 1329555`), class spell
  `reckless_swings`. Spearing Strike deals 75% weapon damage and 150% against Giants and
  Dragonkin (rows; was 40% and 120%). Furious Precision is unchanged (4/7/10% off hand hit).
  Not simulated: Lingering Rage (the Rage decay out of combat) and Gore Drinker (healing). Not
  taken: Booming Voice's new cut to Piercing Howl's cost (Piercing Howl has no class mask here and
  no rotation casts it), and Defensive Stance's 80% and Defiance's 20% threat, which stay the
  notes' values although the 4 November store and Wowhead's tooltips still state 30% and 15%
  (`tools/dev_notes_check.py`).
- The launch client's Shaman Enhancement tree, Holy Shield's fourth rank, the Orc racial Command
  and the Mage's Clearcasting (the notes of 2 November 2026 and the live data of 4 November,
  Forever preparation; the reference keeps its own order and rows). The Shaman reads talent
  strings in the client's order (`prepare::talent_layout`, as the Druid, Hunter and Mage do), in
  which Wowhead's talent calculator moves Improved Ghost Wolf from the second row's last square
  to the fourth row's last, after Stormstrike, so the seven talents between it and its old place
  shift one square earlier; Elemental (Call of Thunder in Lava Burst's square, Lightning Mastery
  in Elemental Mastery's) and Restoration keep their positions. A string written in the old
  order reads wrongly when it fits the new ranks, so the app has to re-encode its saved
  Enhancement builds (the engine refuses only those that put more points in a talent than it has
  ranks, such as three in Shamanistic Focus, naming it). Holy Shield has a fourth rank
  (1239570, learned at 60, 240 mana, 221 damage and 30% block, the row build 70755 completes):
  a rotation that names it casts it, and one that names rank 3 (20928, 195 mana and 153 damage
  since push 113554) still casts rank 3. Command (20575) now has two effects on Wowhead's spell
  page: all effects of the Tamed Pet Passive +5% (the Hunter's pet, kept as the 5% on its
  damage) and "Modifies Damage/Healing Done" +5% on Firebolt and Lash of Pain alone, so an Orc
  Warlock's Imp and Succubus gain 5% on those two spells, added to their other damage
  modifiers, and its other demons nothing (it was 5% on every pet's damage; hotfix push 113702
  undid this, see below). Clearcasting is
  spent as the cast's effects apply rather than as it completes (wowsims/forever #831): an Arcane
  Missiles cast Missile Barrage pays for leaves it standing, and the check at completion found
  Missile Barrage already spent whenever it had been gained before the Clearcasting, which
  was 23 of 68 such casts in sixty seeded fights on the Arcane board.
- A damage bonus applied after the calculation is threat too (`threat_follows_damage_bonus`,
  Forever preparation), from MythicSim's Discord (26 October 2026, Vrelk: a Shadow Priest with
  no threat talents had less threat than damage). Improved Mind Flay's ramp, Ice Lance on a
  frozen target, Soul Siphon on Drain Life and Wrack, Amplify Curse on Curse of Agony and
  Incinerate on an Immolated target raise a hit's damage after its threat is worked out; the
  reference keeps the threat of the damage before the bonus, so Mind Flay made about 0.82
  threat per damage with no threat talents.
- A precast lands on the pull (`prepull_casts_finish_on_pull`, Forever preparation), from
  SimulationCraft, which executes its one harmful precombat action at 0:00 with its cast time
  skipped (docs/prepull-damage.md). A cast begun before the pull that haste or an early press
  would finish before 0:00 finishes on 0:00, ahead of the pull's first swings and rotation, as a
  player times a precast to the pull. The reference, like wowsims, finishes it early and drops
  its damage, which lands before 0:00: a Skyborne Balance Druid's 2% haste finished the -3.0 s
  Starfire at -0.06 s and lost its 1,533 damage, and the Hunter turret board's Aimed Shot at
  -2.5 s finished at -0.76 s for every race. Damage before 0:00 is still never counted.
- A prepull item swap stays on (`prepull_swap_stays_in_hand`, Forever preparation). A rotation
  that swaps to Swap1 before the pull (a Retribution Paladin's Manual Crowd Pummeler at -1 s)
  has that weapon in its hand at the pull: its damage and speed feed the first swing and every
  strike from 0:00, and the set stays on until the rotation swaps again, as the game never
  swaps back by itself. The reference keeps the Main set's weapon swinging through the prepull
  and registers a swap back to Main a nanosecond before the pull, so a prepull swap is undone
  before the first swing. A swap after the pull is unchanged.
- A channel is clipped by what the rotation would run with it ended (`channel_clip_walks_rotation`,
  Forever preparation). A channel with an `interruptIf` ends early only when the first action the
  rotation would then run is another spell, or a recast with `allowRecast` on. The look reads the
  rotation as it would run once the channel is gone: a group reference counts as the first ready
  action inside it, a running sequence as its current step, a sequence that is not running as
  nothing, the channel's own dot aura as down, and a cast row goes through the major cooldown gate
  as the rotation does. A Warlock's Wrack channelled from a Cooldowns group, or gated on its own
  dot being down, is therefore held to its sixth tick when nothing else would go first. The
  reference counts any ready group as another action and reads the aura as up, so it clipped that
  Wrack at its second tick and recast it every two seconds. The ticks `Channeled Ticks` reads are
  the ticks the dot has dealt since it was applied, in both rule sets: Missile Barrage's shorter
  missile interval drops when the cast completes, and a total rebuilt from the live interval read
  each missile as its number plus the ticks the buff had taken off.
- The Paladin tree and Holy Binding of live server hotfix push 113554 (30 October 2026, applied
  to client 1.60.1.70707 by DBCache, which wago.tools' tables do not carry), from upstream
  wowsims/forever #772 and #773's regenerated rows and Wowhead's Forever talent data (Forever
  preparation; the reference keeps the 70425 tree). The Paladin string reads in the client's order,
  17 talents a tree (`src/classes/paladin/prepare/hotfix_113554.rs`), and a talent above its new
  ranks or a longer tree is refused, so every 70707 string is. Twist of Light, Instrument of Law,
  One-Handed Weapon Specialization, Improved Seal of Fury and Voice of Truth are gone. Unsealed
  Wrath (1310735) stores the active seal in its Echo on each landed melee auto (15 sec, 3 stacks)
  and a swing under a different seal spends every other Echo, each stack a roll of its seal.
  Swift Judgement is a second Judgement on its own 60 sec cooldown. Shieldsworn takes 4 sec off
  Holy Strike, whose landed hits fire the active Holy Shield without a charge and Shield
  Specialization's mana without its cooldown. Conviction is 2/4/6% crit with every spell and
  attack; Holy Power is 10-50% more crit healing; Two-Handed Weapon Specialization also cuts all
  threat 7/14/20% with a two-hander; Champion of the Light is 5 ranks of 12% of Intellect and 0.2
  sec off Hammer of Wrath; Righteous Fury adds 33% to all threat; Vindication gives the paladin no
  attack power; Sacred Duty's Stamina becomes 5/10 sec off Forbearance; Holy Shield's ranks deal
  and cost what the rank below did (Rank 3: 153 damage for 195 mana). Divine Precision 4/8%,
  Improved Seals 3-15%, Reverence 15/30%, Spiritual Focus 14-70%, Redoubt 6-30%, Shield
  Specialization 15/30% and 50/100%, Improved Righteous Fury 3/6/9%, Iron Creed 10-30% and
  2-6%, Boundless Light 15/30% Holy Shock heal crit. Oath of Light is a castable spell (below), and
  Boundless Light holds on a Holy Shock heal only while the Oath is not on the heal target;
  Light's Vigil, now friendly only, refuses a rotation that reaches it, since its party
  heal is not modelled yet; Shieldsworn's spell block, Stoicism and Turn Evil change nothing
  the sim models. Holy Binding (1328569) takes Binding Heal's field: a healer Priest's Flash Heal
  heals the priest for half as much, as a second jump, and Binding Heal's ranks leave the tree.
  Shadow Word: Death's backlash (10% to 30% of maximum health) is self damage the sim does not
  deal.
- Oath of Light (1328548) and Bloom (1328621), the two healer talents of hotfix pushes 113554 and
  113531, from the client text and the rows the pushes carry (wago.tools has neither, and
  upstream wowsims/forever models only the Oath). Oath of Light is an instant 8% base mana cast
  that swears a 5 minute Oath on the heal target, which is the player in the healer model and
  stands for the tank; while it holds, each Holy Light heal that reaches the tank heals 400 more,
  each Flash of Light 115 and each Holy Shock 229 (the rows' 6.67, 1.92 and 3.83 a level at
  level 60), added to the heal's base amount before healing power. The sim heals "a player who
  needs it", so a heal reaches the tank with the tank's share of the party's hits under
  `prepare::party_damage` (5 in 9, `party_damage::tank_share`, carried as the effect's
  `holder_share`); the rest reach players without the Oath, get no bonus and, for Holy Shock,
  keep Boundless Light's crit, which the aura takes off the tank's. A rotation casts it on the
  player (`castFriendlySpell` before the pull, `castSpell` in the list) and again before it ends.
  Bloom heals the target of a Rejuvenation or Regrowth that ends by its duration for 100% of the
  druid's Spirit. The client rows are two dummy effects (100 and 50) and no heal spell, so the
  coefficient, crit and modifiers are not stated: the heal is the Spirit exactly, no healing
  power, no multipliers, no crit, with the overhealing share of a heal at once, and shows as its
  own action (1328621). A heal over time cast again while it runs keeps ticking on its first
  player, so that cast blooms as the new one goes up; one Swiftmend consumes, or the fight cuts
  short, blooms nothing. The dispel case (50% of Spirit) never happens in the sim.
- Party damage for heals that follow it, an assumption until the logs hold them: Forever's level
  30 beta logs have no Prayer of Mending or Chain Heal yet. A healer's party of five takes hits
  at random, the tank about once a second and each of the other four about once every five
  seconds. Prayer of Mending goes on the tank and heals only when the player holding it is hit,
  then moves to another member with 30 seconds again (its buff row, 401877), so a cast recast
  every ten seconds heals about three of its five charges. Chain Heal lands on the tank and jumps
  only to members hit in the last four seconds, 2.72 players a cast on average. Holy Priest
  healing falls about 13%, Restoration Shaman's about 0.5%. Recalibrate the rates once the logs
  reach these heals. The reference heals every charge and jump at once. The prepared `heals`
  effect carries `party`, and each such heal `smart` (`src/prepare/party_damage.rs`).
- Burst healing, a MythicSim measure rather than a game mechanic: a healer sim reports, beside
  its healing per second over the fight (sustained, which its mana spreads thin), the most it
  heals in any ten seconds of each fight over ten seconds (burst), counted as healing per second
  is: heals, ticks and shields on the healer, less overhealing. Ten seconds is a judgement: a few
  casts and a heal over time's ticks, short enough that mana does not decide it. The fixtures'
  bursts run 3 to 4.7 times their healing per second. The prepared player carries
  `burst_window`, and the report's player `burstHps` (`src/prepare/burst_hps.rs`,
  `src/core/fight/burst.rs`). The reference, like Go, reports none.
- A healer's gear, from the client rows (1.60.1.70425): the reference counts many healing items
  and set bonuses for nothing, as it registers neither them nor their sets, and Rust refused a
  healer wearing a set it registers but whose listener Rust left unclaimed. In a healer sim,
  Forever preparation (`src/prepare/healer_gear.rs`) reads the bonus rows (ItemSetSpell, through
  `tools/forever_set_spells.py`) of every set the reference does not register: healing power,
  spell damage, mana per 5 seconds, spell crit, stats, casting regeneration and spell mods, as
  Vestments of Prophecy's Flash Heal and Prayer of Healing bonuses, Vestments of Faith's Renew
  cost or the PvP sets' healing; procs and conditional bonuses are left out. It adds the healing
  bonuses the reference leaves empty: Stormrage Raiment's Regrowth cast time and Rejuvenation
  duration, The Earthfury's Mana Surge (a 25% chance after Healing Wave or Lesser Healing Wave to
  regain 35% of its base cost) and Healing Wave jumping to two more players at 20% of the heal
  before each, and The Ten Storms' 30% more Chain Heal past the first player. It wires the healing
  idols and totems (Idol of Health, Idol of Longevity, Idol of Swiftness, Totem of Life, Totem of
  Flowing Water, Tidal Totem, Totem of Urgency) and Hazza'rah's Charm of Healing and Wushoolay's
  Charm of Nature, whose use gives their rows' cast time and cost mods for 15 seconds. And it
  claims Sudden Insight (Vestments of the Devout and Magister's Regalia, 5 pieces: a cast's 5%
  chance at 200 mana) and The Furious Storm (The Elements 5, The Five Thunders 4: a cast's 4%
  chance at 65 spell power for 10 seconds), which the reference registers. Totem of Life's 80 is
  added to Lesser Healing Wave's roll, as the reference adds Libram of Light's to Flash of Light.
  More set and item bonuses that need the fight: Vestments of Faith's Armor of Faith (a Greater
  Heal crit shields its player for 500) and Epiphany (a cast's 5% chance at 24 mana per 5
  seconds for 30 seconds), Dreamwalker Raiment's Healing Touch crit returning 30% of its cost,
  Vestments of Transcendence's rank 5 Renew on each Greater Heal, and Idol of Rejuvenation's 5%
  on Regrowth's direct heal while a Rejuvenation of the druid's is up (read as "on a target
  under your Rejuvenation", since heals land on whoever needs them), Idol of Synthesis (a second
  off Swiftmend's cooldown for each heal over time up as it is cast), Garments of the Oracle (3:
  a heal's 20% chance to heal the healer for 10% of it), Rotmender's Raiment (5: a heal's cast,
  at most every 2 seconds, puts up Rotmending's 40 every 3 seconds for 15 seconds, counted at
  once), The Earthshatterer (4: the party's Mana Spring 25% stronger; 8: Lightning Shield's 15
  mana per 5 seconds, read as kept up) and Redemption Armor (4: Lay on Hands 12 minutes sooner).
  On use, Blessed Prayer Beads heal for 648 and Enamored Water Spirit's totem restores 33 mana
  every 2 seconds for 24 seconds; Wushoolay's Charm of Spirits, a Lightning Shield trinket, is
  worn without effect. Bonuses that help only the heal's target (Dreamwalker's Rejuvenation
  mana, Totemic Power, Holy Power, Totemic Power's armor) change nothing the healer heals, and
  The Eye of Divinity has no effect in Forever (its tooltip is flavour text).
  The healer trinkets on use: Talisman of Ascendance, which the reference registers, stacks
  Ascendance on each landed heal; Zandalarian Hero Charm, which it does not, starts at twelve
  stacks of 17 spell damage and 34 healing (its tooltip; the row is a dummy) and loses one each
  spell cast; Scarab Brooch shields the player each direct heal lands on for 15% of the healing
  it did, counted on the item; Natural Alignment Crystal gives heals and their ticks 20% and
  spells 20% more cost. A stacking trinket whose stacks only melee or ranged hits move, as Badge
  of the Swarmguard, is worn without effect. The prepared effects are `mana_on_cast`,
  `spell_mod_aura_on_use`, `stacking_cd_on_use`, `shield_on_heal` and the heals' shapes; a sim
  that is not a healer's keeps the reference's gear (`tests/healer_gear.rs`).
- A healer's spells past its heals, from the client rows (1.60.1.70425): the reference has no
  heal for them. A Discipline priest's Penance heals at once and once a second for two more,
  each the bolt row's heal, and deals no damage. A Restoration druid channels Tranquility, its
  periodic heal on the party of five every 2 seconds for 10 seconds, on a 5 minute cooldown.
  Nature's Swiftness (the Druid's and the Shaman's) makes the next heal with a cast time instant,
  and that cast spends it. Water Shield's three globes are each spent, at most once every 3.5
  seconds, by a direct heal of the shaman's that crits, for 2% of the maximum mana (the 16
  October 2026 beta notes); the globes taken spell hits spend are not modelled, since the healer
  takes none. The prepared effects are `instant_cast_aura`, the shaman's `water_shield` and the
  heals' channel shapes (`tests/healer_spells.rs`).
- A healer Priest's talents that read a heal's target or its history, from the client rows and
  tooltips: Divine Aegis (431622) turns each crit of a direct heal, Penance's bolts and Prayer of
  Mending's charges into an absorb of 5%, 10% or 15% of the heal, counted as the absorb aura's
  (431624) shielding; the share is taken before the overhealing share comes off and the absorb
  is full, like Power Word: Shield's. A heal over time never shields. Renewed Hope (425280) gives
  Lesser Heal, Heal, Greater Heal, Flash Heal and Penance 2% crit a point on a member of the
  party with Weakened Soul (6788, 15 seconds) and cuts that debuff by 1 second a point: a heal
  goes to a member at random in proportion to the party's hit rates (the assumption above), and
  Power Word: Shield goes to the first member in the party's order without the debuff. Litany of
  Light (1317006) returns 5% or 10% of a heal's base mana cost when the heal before it was a
  different spell, not another rank of the same one. Desperate Prayer (19243) is a self heal at
  no cost on a 10 minute cooldown that a rotation casts when it names it. The prepared effect is
  `priest_heal_talents`, and a heal's `crit_absorb` (`tests/healer_spells.rs`).
- Healer talents past the heals, from the client rows and Forever's tooltips: Riptide's third
  effect makes a Chain Heal cast directly on its target heal 25% more. The sim has no
  per-player auras (a heal lands on a player who needs it), so a Chain Heal's first player is
  read as the Riptide holder while a Riptide of the shaman's is up, a healer swinging Chain Heal
  at the player it Riptided and the party model's Chain Heal starting on the tank; the jumps
  keep their falloff of the unboosted heal, and Riptide is not spent (its row states no
  consumption). Genesis (1223081) is 2% a rank on the periodic healing of Rejuvenation,
  Regrowth and Wild Growth, its first effect, and on Swiftmend, its second, which the
  reference's Genesis (Rejuvenation and Regrowth alone) did not reach. The prepared effect is the
  heal's `hot_bonus` with `first_target_only` (`tests/healer_talents.rs`).
- Mana Tide Totem and Light's Vigil, the last two healer talents, from the client rows.
  The Restoration shaman's own Mana Tide Totem (rank 4, 1325256; Forever's rules, the talent
  taken) costs the row's 60 mana, stands 13 seconds on a 5 minute cooldown and gives its Mana
  Tide row's (1325257) 290 mana every 3 seconds to its group; the sim models the shaman's own
  mana, as MP5 the way Mana Spring Totem's ticks are (483.3 MP5 for 13 seconds, 1,257 mana
  against four whole ticks' 1,160), the same MP5 as the raid's external Mana Tide Totem option,
  which it stacks with. It stands in the water totem slot: its cast ends a Healing Stream Totem
  and its heals over time, and a Healing Stream Totem cast ends it, so a rotation recasts neither
  while the other stands. A cast takes no target. Light's Vigil on an ally (rank 3, 1311595 at
  level 60; push 113554, the Holy Paladin healer sim) costs the row's 1,340 mana on a 1.5 second
  cast with a 6 second cooldown and puts a 30 second vigil on the player, one at a time; the next
  Holy Shock heal on the player spends it, triggers no cooldown and heals the player and the four
  others of the party for 704 plus 0.143 of healing power, each with its own roll and crit (Holy
  Power's crit healing reaches it and a group heal's overhealing share comes off; Healing Light
  does not, as its mask omits the vigil, and Illumination does not, since the heal has no cost
  to refund). The enemy strike and the refund are gone. Any other build's rotation that casts it is
  refused as before. The prepared effects are `mana_tide_totem` and `lights_vigil_ally`
  (`tests/healer_talents.rs`).
- Chance on hit items with no stated rate, a MythicSim assumption: Blizzard states no rate for
  them. Their client trigger rows read `ProcChance` 101, the server's "chance on hit" sentinel,
  with no procs per minute, and the reference leaves them unregistered (its generator's "states
  no rate" blocks, and rows it had no constructor for), so a sim wearing Seeping Willow,
  Empyrean Demolisher or Felstriker ran as if the effect did not exist and said nothing. Forever
  preparation registers them from those blocks and the client rows (`CHANCE_ON_HIT_ITEMS`,
  `tools/rust_item_effects.py`) at the rate Classic servers give a `ProcChance` of 101: 1.8% per
  landed hit for each second of the hitting weapon's speed, 1.08 procs a minute. A weapon procs on
  its own hits, special attacks included; any other item on the wearer's landed melee and ranged
  hits; spells never. A damage over time the proc puts on alone rolls the magic hit as it goes on
  where it is magic and its ticks deal their amount, one around the wielder goes on every target,
  and one a missile carries goes on as the hit lands, its flight not modelled.
  `docs/forever-chance-on-hit.md` lists the items by kind and those left out with the reason
  (crowd control, threat, mana, heals, debuffs only a tank feels). A wearer buff that changes
  stats (Destiny's Strength, Quel'Serrar's Armor and Attack Power, Ragehammer's Attack Power) is
  a stat aura, so its stats reach the runtime and a tank's swing rolls are read with it up
  (`chance_on_hit_stat_auras`, `src/prepare/export_items.rs`). Quel'Serrar's Sanctuary (22850)
  also grants 13 Defense (`A_MOD_SKILL` of skill line 95), which the effect parser leaves out;
  it is added to the buff (`src/prepare/forever_items.rs`). A tank's swing rolls read it, and
  the stat aura combinations carry the crit the player takes when one changes it, which the
  runtime sets on a Goblin Sapper Charge's hit on its thrower. Its 36 melee Attack Power against
  Dragonkin (aura 102, creature mask 2) is a `mob_type_bonus` with `melee_attack_power` while the
  buff is up and every target is Dragonkin; ranged attacks do not read it.
- Arcane Concentration at the Arcane Missiles channel start and on Flamestrike's ground ticks,
  from Forever combat logs: Clearcasting came from 8.9% of 347 channel starts, and 45.3% of
  5-missile channels gained it, against 46.9% expected with a roll at the start and 41.0%
  without; and from 13 of 82 Flamestrike ticks, once a tick however many enemies stood in it.
  Under Forever's rules the channel rolls once as it starts, after the cast has spent any
  Clearcasting it found, so a start proc is a fresh one for the next cast, and each ground tick
  rolls once after the first enemy it lands on. Both share the talent's 1 sec cooldown
  (`tests/classes/mage/arcane_concentration.rs`). The reference rolls on neither.
- Stat aura combinations up to 16 bits, where the reference refuses past 14: an Orc
  Enhancement Shaman with Jom Gabbar takes 15 (the totems, the swap, the imbues and the potion
  10, Blood Fury 1, Jom Gabbar's stacks 4). Each bit doubles the reset simulations: 15 bits
  prepare in about 5 seconds (`src/prepare/stat_auras.rs`).
- The Black Book (19337) as the Forever client states it: Blessing of the Black Book (23720)
  lands on the demon that is out, every effect of its row on the pet, 100% more damage done in
  every school (aura 79) and 100% more armor (aura 101) for 30 sec, and the item's use is on a 5
  minute cooldown and its category's 30 seconds (client 70707 ItemEffect 102765). The pinned
  reference registers Classic's book instead (200 spell damage, 325 attack power and 1600 armor
  on each demon, a 3 minute cooldown, a warlock aura no effect describes), which the reference
  rules keep and still refuse. Under Forever's rules the use waits for a demon out and doubles its
  damage (`black_book`, `src/classes/warlock/prepare/items.rs`); the armor is read by nothing, as
  nothing swings at the demon.
- Forever's Engineering ammo, from the Wowhead Forever tooltips: Swiftfeather Arrow (274387) and
  Swiftstrike Shot (274388), item level 65 and requiring level 60, each "Adds 24.5 damage per
  second". The reference's ammo stops at Miniature Cannon Balls, so the request schema adds them
  to `HunterOptions.Ammo` as `SwiftfeatherArrow` (13) and `SwiftstrikeShot` (14)
  (`src/contracts/request/schema.rs`), leaving `data/proto-schema.json` as the pinned reference
  wrote it. They are data, not a departure, so both rule sets add the 24.5.
- Shadow Oil, from the client 1.60.1.70707 data: item 3824 (use spell 3594, level 24) puts
  temporary enchantment 25 on a melee weapon, a proc effect at the 15% its `EffectPointsMin`
  states, casting spell 350026, a Shadow Bolt of Shadow damage that rolls 52 plus 0.9 a level with
  0.15 variance and takes 0.56 of spell power. It is Frost Oil's twin (item 3829, use spell 3595,
  enchantment 26, 10% of Frostbolt 350025, the fork's patch 126): a flat chance on each landed hit
  of the oiled hand, not procs per minute, with no proc manager, so `mhImbueId` and `ohImbueId`
  take 3594 or 3824 as they take 3595 or 3829, the oil on the main hand's swap weapon follows the
  item swap as Frost Oil does, and each oiled hand has its own listener (`Shadow Oil (main hand)`,
  `Shadow Oil (off hand)`) with the bolt's row `ProcChance` as its chance. The Go reference has no
  Shadow Oil and ignores the id, so both rule sets register it, as with the ammo above
  (`src/prepare/proc_oil.rs`, `tests/classes/proc_oil.rs`).
- Oil of Immolation, from the client 1.60.1.70707 data: item 8956 (level 31) uses spell 11350
  "Fire Shield", a 15 second aura with a periodic trigger spell effect every 3 seconds that casts
  spell 11351 on the user, a Fire school damage effect of 50 base points (a flat 50, no spell
  power) on the enemies within 5 yards of the caster. The use has no cooldown and no global
  cooldown, and its category (79, 3 seconds) is not the potion category (4), so it shares nothing
  with the potions. Neither row is in the pinned game data, so `src/prepare/oil_of_immolation.rs`
  restates them as literals. A request opts in with `consumables.oilOfImmolation: true`, a
  Rust-only boolean of the consumables message (`FOREVER_FIELDS` in
  `src/contracts/request/schema.rs`, field 1000; the Go reference refuses it as an unknown
  field). The character uses the oil 0.5 s before the pull, so the shield is up at the pull, and
  again each time the shield ends, all fight. Every 3 seconds from each use (the first tick 2.5 s
  into the fight), the fifth on the moment the shield ends, spell 11351 deals its 50 as a magic
  hit with a crit to every target, rolled for each target in turn, and shows in the actions as
  spell 11351; the shield's uptime shows as aura 11350 ("Oil of Immolation"). The client rows
  have no tick at the moment of the use (no `START_PERIODIC_AT_APPLY` on spell 11350), so a use
  loses no tick. Using the oil while a swing timer is running stalls the auto attack for 0.5 s,
  which is why players use it before the pull, where none is running (a report from Bae, a
  Classic player on the project's Discord, not a client row: "0.5 sec swingtime stunt when using
  it during swings"). Each use in combat therefore pushes the player's running melee swings, the
  main hand and a dual wielder's off hand, back by 0.5 s (`swing_delay_ns` on the effect); a hand
  that is not swinging (out of melee range, or before the pull) loses nothing and the ranged auto
  is not delayed. Bae also said a prepot "loses 1 of the 5 ticks"; with the client's timing a use
  at -0.5 s loses none, so the rules do not drop one. The fight models one distance between the player and the targets
  (`distanceFromTarget`), so the tick reaches all of the targets or none: a character beyond 5
  yards, such as a ranged character at range, takes none. Nothing changes without the field
  (the prepared effect is `oil_of_immolation`, `src/core/fight/oil_of_immolation.rs`,
  `tests/classes/oil_of_immolation.rs`).
- A Shadow Priest's Dark Inspiration in the party, from wowsims/forever at ce4dd1a69
  (`darkInspirationMeta`, `PartyBuffs.dark_inspiration`) and the client 70425 rows: the talent
  (1326159, 5 ranks) has Mind Blast and a full Mind Flay channel raise the Spirit of the priest's
  party by the buff row's 15% (1326168, `A_MOD_PERCENT_STAT`) priced by rank, round(15 * rank /
  5)%: 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15. A request sets the priest's rank with `partyBuffs.darkInspiration`, a
  Rust-only int32 of the party buffs (`FOREVER_FIELDS`, field 1001, as upstream's field 15 is
  Grace of Air Totem in the pinned schema), held to 5. The party's copy is up all fight on the
  player, never its pets, as upstream's is. Under Forever's rules a Shadow Priest's own copy bids
  in the party copy's Spirit category and yields ties (upstream `NewSpellDataDarkInspirationAuraFor`, `YieldsTies`),
  so the two never stack: the stronger holds the Spirit, the party's on a tie
  (`src/prepare/buffs/dark_inspiration.rs`, `tests/classes/dark_inspiration.rs`). Nothing changes
  without the field.
- A Rogue's swap set of poisons, from a player request (Discord #feature-requests, 5 November
  2026: Ambiwar's Deadly Poison on both hands until it has five stacks, then a second main hand
  carrying Instant Poison). Under Forever's rules a Rogue's item swap is a copy of each swapped
  weapon, the same item, random suffix and enchant, carrying a poison of its own: the request
  names it with `consumables.mhImbueSwapId` (the reference's field) and
  `consumables.ohImbueSwapId`, a Rust-only int32 of the consumables message (`FOREVER_FIELDS`,
  field 1002). Each poison is registered once for both sets and its proc mask follows the set
  worn: the export gives the reset's, the item swap's changes give the swap set's, and the
  Rogue's runtime switches each poison's hands at the swap. The swap costs what every class's
  item swap costs in the engine, Go `ItemSwap.SwapItems`: the global cooldown extends to at
  least 1.5 seconds (`GCDDefault`) and both swings restart a full swing after it
  (`StopMeleeUntil`), as Bae checked in game for a Warrior (Discord #warrior, 23 October 2026);
  neither is checked for a Rogue in game yet. Another weapon, a stone or oil the sets differ in,
  and the reference's rules, whose Rogue reads the request's poisons alone, are refused
  (`src/classes/rogue/prepare/poisons.rs`, `tests/classes/rogue/item_swap.rs`). Nothing changes
  without an item swap.
- The Zul'Gurub crafted sets, from the client 1.60.1.70425 ItemSet and ItemSetSpell rows: Blood
  Tiger Harness needs Leatherworking and The Darksoul Blacksmithing (RequiredSkill 165 and 164
  at 300), as Bloodvine Garb needs Tailoring, and Bloodsoul Embrace and The Darksoul give their
  bonus at 3 pieces, not the reference's 2 (`data/go-tables.json` carries the 3). They are data,
  so both rule sets follow them; no Go golden wears enough pieces to reach either count
  (`src/prepare/forever_item_sets.rs`).
- Beaststalker Armor (Dungeon Set 1) on a class other than a Hunter: Forever does not lock the
  set to its class (classMask 0), and its five piece bonus reads "Your normal ranged and melee
  attacks have a chance of restoring 200 mana" (trigger row 450577, 5% on landed autoattacks).
  The reference attaches the trigger to any wearer but its handler only in the Hunter package, so
  on anyone else the listener did nothing and Rust refused it. Under Forever's rules it restores
  the 200 mana to any wearer with a mana bar, a spell batch window after the hit, as the Hunter's
  does (the prepared effect is `mana_proc`, `src/prepare/export_items.rs`); a Hunter keeps
  `hunter_set_mana_proc`, and the reference rules still refuse it.
- Fire totem reach, from the client 1.60.1.70755 rows and tooltips: a fire totem stands where
  the shaman drops it, "at the feet of the caster", which the fight models as the shaman's
  distance from the targets at the cast (one distance for every target, so a totem reaches all
  of them or none). Magma Totem's pulse burns enemies within 8 yards of it (10581's area), Fire
  Nova hits "enemies within 10 yd of your active Fire totem" (408428's area) and Searing Totem
  attacks an enemy within 20 yards (10436's range). Out of reach the totem is still dropped and
  the nova still cast, for their mana and global cooldown, and deal nothing; moving after the
  drop does not move the totem. The reference hits every target from any distance, as upstream
  wowsims does (`radius_yards` and `attack_range_yards` on the prepared effects,
  `tests/forever_totems_20261104.rs`).
- The shaman's own Windfury Totem beside the party's or a main hand Windfury Weapon: both totems
  give the same party aura, 10612, which neither stacks (no cumulative aura) nor stacks for
  different casters, and every rank of Windfury Weapon "disables any benefit you personally
  receive from Windfury Totem" when applied to the main hand. Under Forever's rules the own
  totem is cast (air slot, mana, global cooldown) and its trigger stays off while the party's
  totem stands or the imbue is up; an item swap that takes the imbue off lets it back on at
  once. The reference refuses the request, as before (`one_aura` on `windfury_totem_self`).
- Soul Siphon counts the Affliction effects active at each tick. Its client 1.60.1.70755 text:
  Drain Life, Drain Soul and Wrack deal "12% per each of your other Affliction effects active on
  the target, up to a maximum increase of 36%". The talent is a dummy aura, so the server counts,
  and Forever's damage over time reads the caster's modifiers at each tick, so each Drain Life and
  Wrack tick counts what is up then: the warlock's Bane of Agony or Bane of Doom, Corruption,
  Siphon Life and its own Curse of the Elements or Curse of Recklessness (skill line 355), at most
  three. The raid's curse is another caster's and does not count. The reference counts every
  registered Affliction aura on the target, active or not (Go `AfflictionCount`), which is the
  full 36% on every tick (`soul_siphon_live` on `drain_life` and `wrack`,
  `tests/forever_soul_siphon_20261104.rs`).
- Feral druid attack power shares, measured in game: a Tauren druid's combat log at levels 22 to 25
  on client 1.60.1.70862 (7 November 2026), against client rows that state none of them. Rake's
  hit takes 6.5% of attack power (0.0648 fitted) and each tick the same share (0.0652 fitted): at
  221 attack power with Savage Fury 2/2 the hit read 45 on 26 of 26 hits and the tick 37 on 55 of
  55, where 0.06875 gives a tick of 38, and a weapon damage buff moved neither, so neither has a
  weapon term. Rip takes 0.0114 of attack power a tick for each combo point (up to four, the cap
  kept), read at each tick and not snapshotted: 17 ticks at 3 and 4 combo points and 192 to 239
  attack power fit floor(4 + 5.5 x points + k x attack power x points) for k from 0.0113 to
  0.0115. Swipe takes 3% of attack power on each hit (0.0301 fitted on 457 rank 2 hits), the same
  share on every rank. Rake and Rip were measured on rank 1 and Swipe on ranks 1 and 2; the other
  ranks carry the share, unmeasured, and the engine reads one share for whichever rank it casts.
  Swipe's rank 5 took 5% until now (a fit of the beta logs) and takes 3% too: the
  Bear board's rotation never casts Swipe and does not move, a Bear with Swipe as a filler loses
  3.3% (364.1 to 352.0 DPS), and the production Cat goes from 706.6 to 701.2 (-0.8%). Forever's rules take Rake 0.065 (was the
  notes' 1.25 times the reference's 5%, 0.0625), Rip 0.0114 (was 0.0125, the notes' 1.25 times 1%)
  and Swipe 0.03; the reference keeps 5%, 1% and 5% (`attack_power_share` and
  `attack_power_share_per_combo_point` on `rake` and `rip`, `attack_power_coefficient` on `swipe`;
  no new field). Ferocious Bite's 3% a combo point was not measured and keeps the notes' 25%. An
  avoided Ferocious Bite (miss, dodge or parry) gets back 80% of its 35 base energy, as its row's
  Discount Power On Miss attribute states, and keeps the extra energy and the combo points: five
  avoided bites in the log cost 6.1 to 6.7 energy. Both rule sets already did, from the row's
  attribute, so nothing changes there; the test pins it
  (`tests/forever_feral_measured_20261107.rs`).
- Eclipse banks its two charges only when a Wrath lands. Eclipse 408248 (client 1.60.1.70790)
  has SpellAuraOptions ProcTypeMask_0 65536, a harmful spell's damage, so a Wrath that misses
  triggers nothing, as Sildor (#druid) tested on the beta; the charges land with the Wrath, after
  its travel. The reference banks them on every completed Wrath cast (`bank_on_landed_hit` on
  `eclipse`, `tests/forever_eclipse_on_hit_20261105.rs`).
- Low level weapons and armor the reference database lacks: about 400 rows of the live
  client as of 6 November 2026 (wago.tools ItemSparse and Item, with Wowhead Forever tooltips for
  armor, damage, speed and block), such as Worn Cloak (1733) or Crude Bastard Sword (1412), which a
  leveling character wears. The reference refuses them as an unknown item. Forever's rules read
  them from `data/forever-client-items.jsonl` for an id `data/items.jsonl` lacks; the pinned
  import is untouched and the reference's rules still refuse them. Since 8 November 2026 the file
  also holds the items the Forever client adds whose ItemSparse rows the client ships encrypted
  (wago.tools cannot read them), from their Item row and Wowhead Forever tooltip alone, such as
  Berserker Shackles (274600), and equip lines that are a plain stat (Defense, Attack Power,
  spell power, hit, crit, mana per 5 sec, dodge, parry, block) read as `data/items.jsonl` holds
  the same line of a Classic item. Items with a use, chance on hit or other equip effect, a set
  bonus or a line the generator does not read are left out and stay refused
  (`tools/rust_client_items.py`, `tests/forever_client_items_20261106.rs`,
  `tests/forever_client_items_20261108.rs`). The rerun of 9 November 2026 added the 71 items whose
  tooltips Wowhead decoded since, 14 of them with a creature type attack power line written to
  `data/forever-client-item-bonuses.jsonl` as the Ceremonial Mallet's is, such as Nama's
  Cherished Necklace (279893); Wowhead's notes on where an item drops ("Dropped by", "Drop
  Chance") are not item lines (`tests/forever_client_items_20261109.rs`). Since 10 November 2026
  39 more items are taken whose other lines were unread: a line that changes nothing in a fight
  (mount, travel and swim speed, a zone, falling, stealth detection, a profession, quest text, a
  use or proc that only controls or dispels an enemy) is left out of the row, and expertise
  ("Reduces chance to be Dodged or Parried by 1.0%": 10 ExpertiseRating), "+N Weapon Damage"
  (PhysicalDamage), a weapon skill (`pseudo_stats`) and "+N to All Resistances" read as the
  reference rows hold them. "Increases damage done to <creature type> by magical spells and
  effects by up to N" is spell damage against that type in the bonus file, which the export turns
  into a `mob_type_bonus` as Mark of the Champion's (`tests/forever_client_items_lines_20261110.rs`).
- Items whose live row differs from the reference database: Forever's rules read
  `data/forever-live-items.jsonl` before `data/items.jsonl`, and the reference's rules keep the
  pinned rows. The first rows are the Alterac Valley reputation off hands and shield, which the
  live game moved from item level 65 to 60 while the reference rows kept the item level 65 budget
  (Wowhead's Forever tooltips and gear planner, 6 November 2026, sold by Thanthaldis Snowgleam
  and Jekyll Flandring): Tome of Arcane Domination, Tome of Shadow Force and Tome of the Ice Lord
  31 of their school (was 34), Tome of Fiery Arcana 37 Fire (was 40), Lei of the Lifegiver 37
  healing and 12 damage (was 40 and 13), Therazane's Touch 29 (was 31) and The Immovable Object
  66 block value, its 41 Block and 25 Block Value (was 71). A live row keeps its reference row's
  name and kind (`src/data.rs`, `tests/forever_av_vendor_items_20261106.rs`).
  The second batch (Wowhead's Forever tooltips of 7 November 2026) comes from reading the tooltip
  of every item the reference rows state differently from Wowhead's gear planner or from the
  client's item data, every item a reference, trinket board or race request wears, and every
  armor bearing item whose reference row has no Armor (910 rows, 908 of which the live tooltip
  gives an armor). It adds 1,004 rows: 931 state only an Armor the row lacked or had wrong, 31
  change the weapon damage (a caster weapon rolls lower damage live, Witching Stave 40 - 61 not
  55 - 83, Elemental Mage Staff 109 - 164 not 147 - 221, Mograine's Might 105 - 159 at 3.40 not
  87 - 131 at 2.80, and the thrown knives roll a wider range around the same average), 20
  change a shield's block value (the Premier shields and Evergreen Shield 44, was 58, Wormscale
  Blocker 57, was 75, Blessed Qiraji Bulwark 70, was 88), 14 state a spell power the reference
  scaled otherwise (Atiesh 150, 300 healing on the healing version, was 216 and 424, Spellshifter
  Rod 40, was 54), and the rest fix a primary stat: Gemshale Pauldrons, Dragonclaw Ring,
  Stonerender Gauntlets, Runemender's Seal and a few more. Two stat-bearing equip effects change
  too: Mace of Unending Life gives 140 feral attack power (was 280), Hammer of Bestial Fury
  carries none (its tooltip lists no effect; the reference row had 154), and Shard of the
  Defiler's "Improves your chance to get a critical strike by 15.0%" and "Increases your attack
  speed and casting speed by 15.0%" become 210 melee crit rating and 150 melee and spell haste
  rating, which the reference row left to an effect the engine does not model. Items whose
  tooltip lists a resistance, mana per 5 sec or spell piercing figure as a base plus an extra for
  Forest and Grassland areas (Rune of Duty, the Volunteer's and Relentless Raider's seals)
  already match: the row states the base and an area stat. Tooltips are missing for the hidden
  stat items (`statsHidden` in the gear catalog) and those rows are left as they were
  (`tests/forever_live_item_stats_20261106.rs`).
  The third batch (Wowhead's Forever tooltips of 8 and 9 November 2026, every weapon and armor
  row of `data/items.jsonl` without a live row: 10,909 asked, 10,307 revealed)
  adds 421 rows with `tools/rust_live_items.py`, which keeps the reference row and changes only
  what the tooltip states otherwise (its docstring has the rules). Most change a primary stat or
  spell power the live game retuned: Tarnished Elven Ring 10 Agility and 10 Arcane Resistance
  (was 15 Agility), Hand of Justice 12 Attack Power (was 20), Crimson Felt Hat 10 Intellect and
  10 Spirit (was 8 and 8), Barbarous Blade 50 Attack Power (was 60), Skyshroud Leggings 11
  Stamina, 12 Intellect and 30 spell power (was 8, 8 and 34), Second Wind 15 healing and 5
  damage (was 22 healing), Blood-etched Blade 66 spell power at 26 - 49 (was 6 at 39 - 74); 55
  change a weapon's damage and 6 its speed. Rerun `fetch` then `build` to pick up later reveals
  (`tests/forever_live_item_stats_20261109.rs`). Tests that sim one request under both rules
  and compare the rolls take the live items off first (`tests/support/live_items.rs`). The same
  tooltips add seven client items (`tools/rust_client_items.py build`, 576 rows): Forever's own
  copies of Choker of the Fire Lord, Quick Strike Ring, Heavy Dark Iron Ring, Band of Sulfuras,
  Cauterizing Band and Ring of Spell Power (288926 to 288931) and of Hammer of Bestial Fury
  (289292).
- Command on a Warlock's demons since the hotfixes of 6 November 2026 ("Fixes an issue where some
  Warlock pet abilities were benefitting too much from the Orc Command racial ability", Forever
  preparation; the reference has no Command). In client 1.60.1.70862 Command (20575) has two
  effects: SpellEffect 697942 adds 5 to all effect points (aura 107, misc 8) of the Tamed Pet
  Passive (DND) (18727 to 18730, class set 5 mask 0x4000000), whose one effect is damage done
  percent on all schools at 0, so the demon deals 5% more damage of every kind, melee included;
  SpellEffect 697943 (aura 108, 5% damage on Firebolt and Lash of Pain, mask 0x3000) is rewritten
  to 0 by hotfix push 113702, the fix for those two spells taking it on top of the first. An Orc
  Warlock's four demons now deal 5% more of all their damage and Firebolt and Lash of Pain
  nothing more; a gear guardian such as the Emerald Dragon Whelp gets nothing
  (`tests/orc_command_20261106.rs`). The Hunter's pet keeps its 5%.
- Warrior threat measurements at levels 20 to 24 (in game, 7 November 2026). The rage of an
  avoided hit, Shield Specialization's on a block and Master of Defense's on a dodge or parry,
  makes 5 threat a point in Battle and Defensive Stance alike and Defiance does not scale it, so
  its energize resource is marked unscaled (`unscaled_threat` on the `rage_on_avoid` trigger),
  where the reference takes the warrior's threat multiplier at the gain. Whether a threat buff
  scales it is not measured. Cleave rank 1 adds 30 threat beyond its damage on one target (about
  15 on each of two), times the stance, where the per level figure of the other ranks (1.53)
  would give 30.6. Victory Rush's heal, which makes healing threat, is not modelled: Victorious
  comes up on a kill and nothing in a fight dies, so the spell is never cast
  (`tests/forever_warrior_threat_20261107.rs`).
- Hamstring and Shield Bash threat, from the same measurements. Hamstring is 1.25 times its
  damage (its crits for 8 make 10, where a flat +1 would make 9) and Shield Bash 1.5 times (crits
  for 8, 8, 9, 10 and 11 read 12.0, 12.2, 13.5, 15.0 and 16.7), with nothing flat. The reference
  adds 135 to every rank of Hamstring and gives Shield Bash its damage
  (`tests/forever_warrior_threat_20261107.rs`).
- A block takes off a whole number: the sheet's block value, floor(shield + Strength x 0.05 - 1),
  so a 6 shield at 59 Strength blocks 7 (the same measurements). Preparation floors the block
  value with an aura's multiplier applied, for the target's swing at a tank and for Shield Slam's
  bonus; the reference takes off the fraction. Whether the game floors the shield or the product
  when a multiplier applies is not measured (`src/prepare/enemy/tests.rs`,
  `tests/forever_physical_damage_20261107.rs`).
- A physical row that deals school damage takes the caster's flat physical damage bonus (from
  gear) at the row's bonus coefficient column, never as spell power: Revenge and Hamstring state 1
  and take all of it, Thunder Clap, Victory Rush and Shield Bash state 0 and take none, and Rend's
  ticks, with no coefficient, take none (the same measurements). A weapon strike keeps taking the
  bonus whole. Preparation carries the column as `physical_school_coefficient` on the spell, for
  a spell that names no coefficient of its own; the reference gives every physical spell the
  whole bonus (`tests/forever_physical_damage_20261107.rs`).
- A physical hit that deals school damage rolls its base points a half Variance either side and
  lands on a whole number, with attack power added on top unspread: Revenge rank 1 states 22 with
  a Variance of 0.154 and lands on 20 to 24, the two ends rarer than the three between, and a
  pet's Claw and Bite and Eviscerate roll the same way (the same measurements); the pet strikes
  the exporter has as a literal range, a Cat's Claw 43 to 59, round the same. Every physical
  school damage row of the client table has no per level gain, which would be added after the
  rounding, so the row's average is its base points (`physical_rolls_are_whole`,
  `src/prepare/physical_damage.rs`). The reference rolls the span without rounding
  (`src/classes/warrior/spells/revenge.rs`).
- Four item gaps found in real sims refused on 9 November 2026 (`tests/forever_item_gaps_20261109.rs`,
  fixtures `forever-gaps/*mallet*`, `*defias*`, `*dualblade*` and `*sword-of-zeal*`):
  - Ceremonial Mallet (279885), an item the client ships with an encrypted ItemSparse row, from
    Wowhead's Forever tooltip: Two-Hand Mace, item level 42, 107 to 161 damage, speed 3.60, +15
    Stamina, "Equip: +22 Attack Power" and "Equip: +33 Attack Power against Undead". The row holds
    the plain stats, as the other Forever client items do; the line against Undead is a creature
    type bonus no item row can state, so `tools/rust_client_items.py` writes it beside the row to
    `data/forever-client-item-bonuses.jsonl`. Forever's preparation gives the item a permanent
    aura (an item swap toggles it, as Mark of the Champion's), and the export describes a
    `mob_type_bonus` of 33 melee attack power when every target is Undead. A target of another
    type or of none, as MythicSim's requests carry, never takes it. Melee attack power only, as
    the client's creature type auras (aura 102) are; whether the game also adds it to ranged
    attack power is not measured. The reference refuses the item as unknown.
  - Defias Leather's 4 piece, Devious Strike (client set spell 1292028 of ItemSetSpell 161, bleed
    1292029), from the Forever tooltip "Grants your melee attacks a 5% chance when striking from
    behind to hit a vital point, causing the target to Bleed for 68 to 83 Physical damage over
    5 sec". The set already registered the listener; nothing claimed it, so the gate refused every
    wearer. The export now describes it: a 5% chance on the wearer's landed white hits for a
    bleed of 15 a second for 5 seconds on the unit hit (the row's 15 base points and 0.2
    variance make 67.5 to 82.5 over five ticks, the tooltip's 68 to 83; the engine ticks the
    average, 75 a proc), with no roll to land. The row states Periodic Can Crit, so ticks roll the
    physical crit, and like every physical dot they take no armor: a periodic tick that can crit
    skips armor as a plain one does (`calc_damage_internal`), where it was taking the target's
    armor through a weapon or set proc's dot. The listener exists only when the wearer is behind
    the target, which every request is unless it sets `inFrontOfTarget`. The set's other
    bonuses are as before: two pieces give 5 Arcane Resistance, five give Increased Daggers +1,
    and three give 15 attack power against humanoids, which a target of no type never takes (a
    request that names a Humanoid target is still refused for the table's bonus stats). The
    reference's set has no fourth piece bonus and its rules prepare none.
  - Guardian's Dualblade (273046), "Equip: When damaged, has a chance to grant you 1080 armor for
    12 sec (Proc chance: 33%, 1m cooldown)" (trigger 1293342, buff 1293345). Its trigger row
    names every damage taken bit, so its callbacks are the hit taken and the periodic damage
    taken, which the exporter's list of hit taken procs did not read. Nothing damages a player
    who is not tanked, so the aura is inert there and the request runs, with no stat aura added
    for a proc that cannot come up; a tank takes the target's swings, each landed hit rolls the
    33% behind the item's minute of cooldown, and the 1080 armor is one of the stat aura
    combinations the target's swings read. The periodic callback never fires, since nothing puts
    a damage over time on the wearer. Under the reference's rules the exporter has no entry
    and refuses the aura as before.
  - A swap onto Sword of Zeal (6622) or Argent Avenger (13246): the helper that adds a weapon
    proc for a custom aura (`AddWeaponProcAura`) registers no item swap callback in the reference,
    so a swap that moves the weapon left the proc's trigger up or down as it was and the swap
    preparation refused the item's effect. Forever's rules register the trigger with the item
    (`register_item_proc`), as every other weapon proc's is, so it is up while the weapon is in
    the hand. A weapon worn without a swap is unchanged. Of the 323 weapons with effects, these
    two and Guardian's Dualblade were the swap weapons this refused beyond a swap's own
    limits.
  - A swap onto Dragon's Call (10847), from the 9 November 2026 follow-up: the weapon's Emerald
    Dragon Whelp is a gear pet the reference builds only for a Dragon's Call in a hand at the
    pull (`RegisterGearPetConstructor`), and the proc opted out without it, so a swap set holding
    the weapon (the Manual Crowd Pummeler opener, an advanced weapon swap set) was refused. Under
    Forever's rules the whelp is also built for a Dragon's Call in a hand of the swap set. It stays
    disabled until a proc summons it, the weapon's proc trigger is switched with the weapon as
    every weapon proc's is, and its proc chances follow the weapon in the hand (the rate is per
    minute of the weapon's swing speed, so the set's weapon rolls it). The proc can therefore come
    only while the weapon is equipped, and a whelp already out stays its 15 seconds after a swap
    away, as any summoned guardian does. The client has no creature rows for the whelp and
    Wowhead's Forever tooltip (10 November 2026) states no rate or duration ("a short period of
    time"), so the 1 PPM, the 45 second category cooldown and the 15 second summon are those the
    worn weapon already used. A Dragon's Call worn without a swap is unchanged, and the
    reference's rules keep refusing the swap. Of the 1,774 main hand capable weapons the swap
    survey ran (a Retribution Paladin, the weapon in the swap set against the same weapon worn),
    184 have an effect that shows in a fight and each follows a swap now, 1,584 show none, and
    the 6 the swap refuses are limits of the swap itself, not of a weapon proc: Dwarven Tree Chopper (2907),
    Servomechanic Sledgehammer (4548) and Shard of the Defiler (17142) carry Expertise or cast
    speed the stat auras hold fixed, Spire of the Stoneshaper (12532) and Headmaster's Charge
    (13937) are on use weapons whose spell flags a swap changes (only the Pummeler's is followed),
    and Runeblade of Baron Rivendare (13505) has a movement aura that displaces another. Six more
    were refused before the creature type fix below. The two with expertise run since the
    expertise follow-up below.
  - Expertise in a swap set, from a Droptimizer run refused on 9 November 2026 (a level 37
    Retribution Paladin on the Pummeler opener, Servomechanic Sledgehammer's set): the runtime
    held expertise at the pull's value, so a swap set whose weapon carries expertise rating
    (Servomechanic Sledgehammer 10, Dwarven Tree Chopper 6) was refused. Expertise is now one of
    the stats the stat aura combinations carry when one changes it, and the target's dodge and
    parry against the player read it live. This is not a departure: the reference reads the
    unit's expertise live too, and a request whose combinations leave expertise alone carries
    nothing new (`tests/swap_expertise_20261109.rs`).
  - An item with an attack power bonus against a creature type (Ceremonial Mallet, Mugg's Jabber
    and Crosser, Scarlet Malice, Katerina's Shanker, Beastslayer's Trident) in a swap set against
    a target of another type: the bonus was described only when it applied, so the swap's toggling
    of the item's aura was refused. With an item swap the effect is now described at zero.

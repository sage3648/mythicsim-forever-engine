//! Live server hotfix pushes 113531 and 113554, which reached client 1.60.1.70707 on 30 October
//! 2026 through the DBCache rather than a client build (wago.tools' CDN tables do not carry
//! them). Only Forever's rules read them; the Go reference keeps the frozen data
//! (client 1.60.1.70425) and its goldens hold.
//!
//! The rows here are the frozen rows with the hotfixed columns changed, each change naming its
//! SpellEffect or Spell column. They come from wowsims/forever #769 (push 113531) and #770 (push
//! 113554), which regenerated the store from Raidbots' `forever` DBCache.bin, and agree with
//! Wowhead's Forever tooltips. Paladin and Priest rows are not here.
//!
//! The live hotfix cache of 3 November 2026 (still client 1.60.1.70707), which carries the Hunter
//! part of Blizzard's development notes of 2 November, is here too: wowsims/forever #824
//! regenerated the store from it (`--cdn --dbcache --carry-hotfixes`).

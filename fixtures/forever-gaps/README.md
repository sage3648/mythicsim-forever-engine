# Forever gap requests

Production Quick Sim requests that the Rust engine refused between 5 and 27 October 2026, which then
ran in the Go engine or needed its exporter to prepare them. The character names are replaced and the iterations cut to 50. Each one
stands for a group of the refused requests and is read by
[tests/forever_gaps.rs](../../tests/forever_gaps.rs), which prepares it under Forever's rules,
checks the gate passes and runs it.

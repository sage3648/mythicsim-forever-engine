//! The Restoration Shaman's heals and heal talents, which Rust alone sims (see
//! `prepare::heals`): every rank of Healing Wave, Lesser Healing Wave, Chain Heal and Healing
//! Stream Totem, and the talent's Riptide, from the client rows of build 1.60.1.70425.
//!
//! Chain Heal lands on three players, each jump at half of the one before, as its row states;
//! under Forever's rules it jumps only to players the party's damage hit lately
//! (`prepare::party_damage`).
//! Healing Stream Totem heals the party of five every two seconds while it stands. Riptide
//! (408521) also makes a Chain Heal cast directly on its target heal 25% more
//! ([`Shaman::riptide_chain_heal_bonus`]); Nature's Swiftness makes the next heal with a cast
//! time instant (`prepare::healer_gear`).

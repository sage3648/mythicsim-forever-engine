//! MythicSim's healer sims, which Rust runs alone (no Go counterpart): a healer casts every heal
//! on a player who needs it, and each heal counts in full, so its healing per second is what it
//! can put out with its mana. A class binds the [`Effect::Heals`](crate::contracts::prepared_v2::Effect::Heals) its preparation exports and
//! hands each cast and tick here.
//!
//! A direct heal rolls the client row and adds the spell's coefficient on healing power, then
//! the caster and player multipliers and the healing crit roll, as Go `CalcAndDealHealing` does.
//! A party heal lands that roll on each player of the party, a chain heal on each jump at the
//! falloff's share of the one before, each with its own roll and crit. A heal over time
//! snapshots its tick and the caster's multipliers when it goes up, as Go `Dot.SnapshotHeal`
//! does. Under Forever's rules each tick rolls the healing crit where the row states Periodic
//! Can Crit (README, Rust-only mechanics); the Go reference's ticks never crit. Cast again while
//! it runs, it goes on another player: the
//! one running is not cut short, and its ticks left are counted when the new one goes up. A shield counts its absorb, with its coefficient and the
//! caster's multipliers, as shielding when it goes up; nothing in the fight hits the shield.
//!
//! Under Forever's rules two heals follow the party's damage ([`PartyDamage`]): each member is
//! hit at its own rate, at random. Chain Heal lands on the tank, then jumps only to the other
//! members hit within the injured window. Prayer of Mending waits on a member until that member
//! is hit; its class runs the buff with [`HealBook::mending`], [`HealBook::mending_wait`],
//! [`HealBook::mending_heal`] and [`HealBook::next_holder`].

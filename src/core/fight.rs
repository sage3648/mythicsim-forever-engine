//! A class-independent fight runtime that mirrors the pinned Go `sim/core`.
//!
//! One player fights one to five identical targets, each with its own auras, dots, armor,
//! stats and metrics. The runtime owns time, the pending-action queue, random
//! streams, units, auras, spells, casting, damage, channels, cooldowns, the rotation and
//! metrics. Class behavior plugs in through [`Agent`], so the runtime never names a
//! class. Event order, random draw order and floating-point operation order follow Go,
//! because the shared random stream makes every later draw depend on them.
//!
//! The runtime is built from a validated prepared v2 input. Static modifiers are already
//! applied there and are never applied again here.
